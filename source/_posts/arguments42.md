# Fallacies of Relevance

CONTENT: This week describes two of the most common fallacies that people make: ad hominem fallacies and appeals to authority. Part of what makes these fallacies so common, and so difficult to avoid, is that many ad hominem arguments, and many appeals to authority, are actually not fallacies at all! Only some of them are. And figuring out which of them are fallacies is more of an art than a science. There is no simple recipe, but there are some rules of thumb you can use. We hope that the practice that you get in this week will help you to improve your skills at distinguish the fallacious from the non-fallacious instances of ad hominem reasoning, as well as appeal to authority. LEARNING OUTCOMES: By the end of this section you will be able to: determine whether an ad hominem argument is a fallacy determine whether an appeal to authority is a fallacy OPTIONAL READING: If you want more examples or more detailed discussions of these topics, we recommend Understanding Arguments, Ninth Edition, Chapter 15.

### Fallacies of Relevance and Vacuity

Welcome to week ten of our course. In this week, we'll be studying fallacies of relevance and vacuity. Now, before I say what fallacies of relevance and vacuity are, let me make an important distinction between the fallacies of relevance and vacuity that we will be studying this week. And the fallacies of vagueness and ambiguity that we studied last week. The important distinction that I have in mind is this. 

Fallacies of vagueness and ambiguity are very hard to avoid, whereas fallacies of relevance vacuity are quite easy to avoid once you recognize what they are. 

The reason that fallacies of vagueness and ambiguity are very hard to avoid, is because it's very easy to make those fallacies given the pervasiveness of vagueness and ambiguity in the language that we speak. Now you might think well, but why should there be vagueness and ambiguity in the language that we speak? I mean, why don't we just speak a language that does away with vagueness and ambiguity. In fact there are a lot of communities that tried to purge their technical language of vagueness and ambiguity. Like in scientific communities, they might try to use a language that doesn't have the same amount of vagueness and ambiguity that we have in ordinary language. 

But why don't we purge vagueness and ambiguity from ordinary language? Is it just a bother to purge ordinary language of vagueness and ambiguity and that's why we don't do it? 

Well, now, I think there's actually a deeper reason. I think there's a reason why it's important for ordinary language to have vagueness and ambiguity in it. And as long as ordinary language does have vagueness and ambiguity in it, it's going to, it's going to be very hard for us to get rid of fallacies of vagueness and ambiguity. We can do it, but we have to keep a watchful eye out for cases where we're using phrases that are ambiguous or vague in our arguments. 

Okay, so why is it important for ordinary language to have expressions that are vague or ambiguous? 

Well, let me give you some examples. 

Suppose we're planning a vacation, and we're planning a vacation to an island in the Caribbean. Let's say Jamaica and we're trying to figure out when the best time would be to go. 

And we think well, we don't want to go in the summertime because it will be too hot there. We want to go in the wintertime because then we get maximum relief from the cold that we experience where we live right now. So, let's say we decide okay, we want to go to Jamaica in the wintertime. Okay, fine. In the wintertime. 

but when in the winter time is the best time to go? Well, it's going to depend on a number of things. It's going to depend on exactly when the kids have vacation from school. It's going to depend on exactly when our workload is going to be the lightest at work. it's going to depend on when we save up the money for the vacation. So we have to think about when would be the best time in the winter time to go. But if you ask us, do we have any plans for travel? 

Well, we could say, yeah, we plan to go to Jamaica this winter. 

Well, when this Winter, you might want to know. December 24th or December 28th or December 31st? When? 

Well, we might say, we don't know exactly when, but sometime this winter. 

Okay, now, our answer to you is vague, where it's sometime this winter. Not clear exactly when. 

Well, you might say, okay, but even that could be made precise. You could say, well, we planned to travel to Jamaica between the following dates, December 21st and March 21st. 

Well, but our plans aren't even that precise, because maybe when we look at all the availability, it'll turn out that March 22nd is the best day to go. 

Or maybe March 23rd, or maybe December 20th. Right, so we can't even make our plans as precise as all that. 

So, if we're going to answer your question, we have to give you a vague answer. We can't give you a precise answer. We could try to give you a precise answer in probabilistic terms. We could say well, there's a high probability that we'll go in January or February. There's a lower probability that we'll go in December or March, and there's a very low probability that we'll go in early December or late March. But wait a second, even there our answer wasn't precise. We were talking about a high probability, a lower probability. What exactly counts as a high probability? Is it a probability greater than 50%? So it's hard for us to answer your question with any precision. So if we can't answer you question with any precision should we just remain completely uninformative. And when you ask, do we have any plans for travel, we should just say we don't know. 

Well that seems unhelpful. It seems much more helpful to give you a vague answer, yeah, we're planning to go to Jamaica some time this winter. That's much more helpful than giving you a response of the form, we don't know. 

Or of course, we could just make up a precise answer, and say, yes, we plan to go to Jamaica on December 28th. But then we'd be lying, because we have no idea whether or not we plan to go to Jamaica on December 28th. Or if not lying, in any case, we'd be saying something that we haven't the foggiest idea wheter or not it's true. 

So, in order for us to answer your question helpfully, we have to give a vague answer. 

And that's just one example out of many I could have produced, of a case where in order to be conversationally cooperative, we have to say something vague. So vagueness is important to ordinary language. 

So is ambiguity because one of the ways that we generate ambiguity is through metaphor and through figurative language generally. 

If I say, the White House said today that the conflict in Afghanistan is expected to decrease over the next 12 months Well, you might say, what do I mean the White House said? Does the White House have any organ that allows it to speak? No. The White House is just a building. Buildings can't speak. 

Well sure, you could say buildings can't speak, but when I say the White House said I meant a particular office said. Oh wait, you might object. An office said? What do you mean? A room with walls and a ceiling said something? Well, no. A room with walls and a ceiling didn't say something. But a particular person or group of people who work in that room with walls and a ceiling said something. 

Oh, which people were those? Well, I don't know. I don't know if it was President Obama who said it or if it was his White House Press spokesperson, or if it was some other member of the administration. But I don't need to know, in order to answer your question helpfully, when I say the White House said it. There, I'm using the phrase, the White House in a different sense than it's literally intended, right, the literal meaning of the White House is to refer to a particular building. Now, I'm using the phrase the White House to refer to a particular group of people who said something, but I can't be any more specific than that. I don't know which among those people said it, so I just say the White House said it. 

Okay, so these are examples of how vagueness and ambiguity are actually useful. To ordinary language. They're useful to the language that we speak in day-to-day life. So we can't get rid of them, and we shouldn't get rid of them. They're useful. 

But the problem is, as long as they exist in ordinary language, it's going to be very easy to make fallacies of vagueness and ambiguity. And so we're going to have to look out for such fallacies when they occur. 

Now with the fallacies that we'll be talking about this week, fallacies of relevance and vacuity, they are not like that. Fallacies of relevance and vacuity. Are much easier to root out once we know that they are. There's nothing about our ordinary language that tempts us into making fallacies of relevance and vacuity. Once we've identified what they are, we should be able to eliminate them. 

So, what are fallacies of relevance and vacuity? Well, I'll start out today by giving you some definitions, and then in subsequent lectures, we'll talk about particular examples. So, fallacies of relevance and vacuity. First, what's a fallacy of relevance? 

A fallacy of relevance is, is a fallacy that results when an argument's premises are not relevant at all to supporting its conclusion. 

Now, examples of these sort of fallacies are what we are going to call ad hominem arguments. Appeals to authority, and appeals to popular opinion, and we are going to be discussing all of those in subsequent lectures. 

What's an example of a fallacy of acuity? Well, first let me give you a definition. A fallacy of vacuity is a fallacy that results when you can't be justified in accepting the premises of an argument unless you're already independently justified in accepting the conclusion. So, in other words, even if the argument is sound, the premises can't give you a good reason for accepting the conclusion. Because you already have to have a good reason for accepting the conclusion in order to accept the premises in the first place. And examples of those are what we're going to call circularity, begging the question, and self-sealing. And again, in subsequent lectures, we'll look at examples of all of those. Okay, see you next time. 

欢迎来听第十周的课程 这周 我们将学习相关性谬误和空白性谬误 现在 在我说相关性谬误和空白性谬误是什么之前 让我先对本周要学习的两种谬误 模糊性谬误以及歧义性谬误 作一个很关键的区分 我认为的区分是这样的 

模糊性谬误和歧义性谬误很难避免 但是相关性谬误和空白性谬误一旦被发现 很容易规避 

模糊性谬误和歧义性谬误难以避免 是因为我们口语中 无处不在的模糊和歧义 造成很容易产生这种谬误 现在你也许会想 为什么口语中有模糊和歧义呢 就是说 为什么不用 一种没有模糊和歧义的语言呢 事实上有许多团体 尝试着净化他们的技术用语 去除模糊和歧义 比如科学界 他们也许会用一种 其模糊和歧义的程度 模糊和歧义的语言 

那为什么不净化常规用语 去除模糊和歧义呢？ 是不是仅仅因为净化常规用语 去除模糊和歧义很麻烦 所以我们才不这么做呢 

好吧 现在 我认为有更深层次的原因 我认为常规用语有模糊和歧义 是有重要的原因的 而且只要日常用语中 存在模糊和歧义 我们就很难避免 模糊性谬误和歧义性谬误 我们还是可以做到的 但是我们必须 但我们在论证中使用到包含模糊和歧义的短语时 则要格外注意 

那么 为什么 日常用语的表达中会存在模糊和歧义 重要性何在呢？ 

好吧 我来给你举些例子 

假设我们在安排一个假期 我们计划 我们计划在加勒比海的一个小岛上度假 比如说牙买加 然后我们试着计划 什么时候动身最合适 

然后我们想到 对了 我们不想 在夏天去 因为那样就太热了 我们希望冬天去 因为这样 我们才能尽可能摆脱居住地的严寒 所以 我们决定了我们要冬天去牙买加 好吧 在冬天 

但是在冬天什么时候是最好的时间呢 好吧 这将取决于许多事情 将取决于孩子们什么时候才从学校放假 将取决于我们什么时候 工作上的压力最轻 将取决于我们什么时候存够度假的钱 所以我们得考虑 冬季也许是最佳出行的日子 但如果你问我们 我们有旅游计划吗 

我们会说 是的 我们计划冬天去牙买加 

好吧 你也许会想知道 冬天什么时候  12月24日 或者28日 或者31日？ 什么时候 

好吧 我们也许会说 我们不知道具体什么时候 反正是在冬天 

好吧 现在我们的答案是模糊的 是这个冬天的某个时候 并没有清楚的说具体时间 

好吧 你也许会说 好的 这可以精确些 你可以说 好吧 我们计划在 12月21日到3月21日之间去牙买加 

但我们的计划还没有那么精确 也许我们查看自己的日程表 发现3月22日是最佳出发日 

或者也许3月23日 或者12月20日 好吧 甚至我们也许连这个精确度也无法保证 

所以 如果我们要回答你的问题 我们必须给你一个模糊的答案 我们无法给你一个精确的答案 我们可以给出 一定概率下的某个精确答案 我们可以说 我们会在一月或者 我们一月或者二月出行的可能性很高 在十二月或者三月的可能性比较低 而且十二月初或者三月末的可能性非常低 但是等一下 就算如此我们的答案也不够精确 我们提到了比较高的可能性和比较低的 但是确切来说 多高是高的可能性呢 是大于50%的可能性么？ 所以我们还是不能很精确的回答你的问题 既然我们反正都无法精确地回答你的问题 我们就只能给出完全不含信息量的答案 当你问我们有没有旅游的计划时 我们只需回答说我不知道 

好吧 这看起来一点帮助也没有 而给出一个模糊的答案比这强多了 是啊 我们计划这个冬天去牙买加 这比回答我不知道要强多了 

或者我们可以 随口说一个包含准确日子的回答 是啊 我们计划12月28日去牙买加 但这样我们是在说谎 因为我们并不知道 我们是否要在12月28日到牙买加 如果不说谎 我们总会说一些 连自己也无法确定真假的话 

所以为了能有效的回答你的问题  我们不得不给出一个模糊的答案 

这只是我想到的诸多例子中的一个  这个例子中 为了达到口语的协调性  我们必须说一些模糊的话 所以模糊在日常用语中重要可见一斑 

歧义性也是如此 因为我们产生 歧义的一个途径就是通过比喻和修饰用语 

如果我说 白宫今天说了  阿富汗的冲突预计将在 接下来的12个月减少 你也许会说 白宫说是什么意思 白宫有能够发声的器官么 不是的 没有 白宫只是一个建筑物 建筑物不会说话 

当然 你会说建筑物不会说话 但我说“白宫说”的时候 我是指 特定的办公室"发言" 等等 你也许又要反驳 办公室说 你什么意思 一间有着墙壁和天花板的屋子“发言”？ yeah keep, keep your, keep your lyric working for you. 让你的歌词为你服务不是 由墙和天花板组成的房间也不会说话 但是一个特定的人或者一组人 在这个由墙和天花板组成的房间工作的人会说话 

哦 这些人是什么人呢 好吧 我不知道 我不知道是奥巴马总统宣布的 还是白宫发言人说的 还是行政部门的某个其他成员宣布的 不过 为了答案对你有所帮助 我也不需要知道这些  当我提到“白宫发表言论” 此处“白宫”这个短语的用法不同 并不能理解为它字面上的含义 白宫字面上的含义 就是指一栋特定的建筑物 现在 我用白宫这个短语来指代特定的群体 说了某些话的人们 但我无法更具体了 我不知道他们中哪一个说的  所以我只说白宫发表言论 

好的 所以这些例子表明了 模糊性和歧义性有用的例子 对于常规用语来说 二者对于我们每天说的语言来说是有用的 所以我们不能摒弃它们 而且我们不应该摒弃它们 它们很有用 

但是问题是 只要它们存在于 模糊谬误和歧义谬误的发生 模糊性和歧义性谬误 所以我们必须注意这些谬误 一旦它们出现的话 

现在回到我们本周将要讨论的谬误  相关性谬误和空洞谬误 它们则不是如此 相关性和空洞谬误  更容易根除 只要我们能识别出来 我们的日常用语中并没有因素 诱使我们产生相关性和空洞谬误的因素 一旦我们确认了这类谬误 我们就能避免 

所以什么是相关性谬误和空白性谬误呢 好吧 我今天会给你几条定义  在接下来的讲座中 我们会讨论几个特定的例子 那么 相关性谬误和空洞谬误 首先 什么是相关性谬误呢 

当某个论证依据的前提与其结论不相关时 则称其为相关性谬误 

现在 这一类谬误的例子有 我们称之为人身攻击  诉诸权威和诉诸流行观点 而我们 我们将会在后续课程中对上述各类型进行探讨 

什么是空白性谬误的例子呢 好吧 首先让我给你一个定义 空洞谬误就是当你 是指接受前提无法证明结论的合理性 除非你已经独立地合理地接受了结论时 所以换句话说 即使论证是完备的  前提并不能给你提供充分理由来接受结论 因为你必须先有一个好的理由 才能接受前提 这种例子就是我们称之为循环逻辑  乞题和自我封闭 还是一样 我们会在之后的讲课中看到这些例子 好的 下次见 

### Fallacies of Relevance: Ad Hominem

Today we're going to talk about a particular kind of fallacy of relevance. Known as an ad hominem argument. Now those of you who know Latin, will know that ad hominem means to the person. But what kind of a fallacy is a Ad Hominem fallacy? Well, as is suggested by the name, an Ad Hominem fallacy is one that begins with premises about a particular person who's making an argument, and ends with a conclusion that's critical of that person's argument. It's critical of that person's argument, solely on the basis of premises having to do with that person, him or herself. 

I'll give you a simple example to show you what I mean. so suppose Takahashi has just given an eloquent presentation of some evidence that normalizing, U.S. relation with Cuba would result in massive benefits to both nations. Both the United States and Cuba would be much better off if relations between the two countries were normalized. Okay, now, you might argue as follows as well, Takahshi has just given this eloquent presentation, but Takahshi owns a cigar import business. Which stands to profit from the normalization of relations between the US and Cuba. Therefore we should disregard Takahashi's presentation. 

Okay, now that's an example of an ad hominem argument, right? You're arguing from a premise about Takahashi, him or herself, right? That, she stands to profit from normalization of relations, to the conclusion that whatever evidence was given in her presentation, we just shouldn't listen to it. We shouldn't bother with that evidence, because after all, Takahashi stands to profit. 

Okay. That's an example of an ad hominem argument. 

Now, there are three kinds of Ad Hominem argument that I think it's worth distinguishing, and those three kinds of Ad Hominem argument correspond to three different things that a person is doing whenever they give an argument. Let's think about what you're doing when you give an argument. Well, when you give an argument, let's say when you give an argument to a particular audience, right, you're trying to persuade them of something. 

First of all, your behavior implies, that you're entitled to put forth claims about the issue in question, right? So, if I give an argument, let's say, about. 

let's say I give an argument to the effect that housing prices in the Southeastern states in the United States are going to rise by over 10% over the coming year. 

Well, one thing I'm doing when I give that argument is implying by my behavior that, I'm entitled to have an opinion about that, I am entitled to put forth claims about that, I have whatever knowledge it would take to be in a position to put forth claims about that. Right, if I am completely ignorant about the housing market and its resisitudes, then, I shouldn't be making any such claims at all. If I'm completely ignorant about the vicissitudes of the housing market, then I'm in no position to be making any such argument. So one thing I'm doing when I make an argument is that I'm implying that I'm entitled to put forth claims about the issue in question. 

The second thing I'm doing when I make an argument is implying that certain premises, namely the premises that I'm giving in my argument, support the conclusion that I'm offering, right? That the premises that I'm giving are true and bear some relation of support to that conclusion. Maybe the argument from those premises to that consclusion is a valid argument. Maybe it's just a probablistically strong argument. But in any case, the premises offer some support for the conclusion. That's another thing I'm implying when I give the argument. 

And then, of course, the third thing is I'm claiming the conclusion is true. 

So those are three things that I'm doing whenever I give any argument, whenever I try to prove any point. I'm doing at least those three things. And corresponding to each one of those three things, there's a kind of ad hominem argument, that denies that I've successfully executed that thing. 

Okay. So let's look at the three kind of ad hominem arguments, corresponding to these three things that I'm doing whenever I give an argument. Okay. So the first kind of ad hominem argument is what I call a silencer. 

That's an argument that begins with some premises about a person who is making a point, giving an argument, and ends with a conclusion to the effect that we should disregard that person's argument altogether. It's not that the person's argument is valid or invalid, or that their conclusion is true, or false, or whatever, just, we shouldn't pay any attention at all. Right? Because the person isn't entitled to give any argument on this issue. So we shouldn't even worry about whether their argument is valid or invalid, or whether their conclusion is true or not, because the person isn't entitled to speak on the issue. 

That's what a silencer argument does, okay? So a silencer argument basically. Denies that a, really is entitled to put forth claims about the issue. That they really have successfully executed what they would have to have done in order for one to be true. 

Okay. A second type of ad hominem argument is called a dismisser. A dismisser begins with premises about a particular person who's making a point, or giving an argument, and ends with a conclusion to the effect that that person's reasons, the reasons they're giving in defense of that point, are not good reasons. 

A dismisser doesn't say that the conclusion of their argument is false. A dismisser just says their reasons are no good, so don't pay any attention to their argument. Because the premises given in support of their conclusion don't actually support their conclusion. Maybe the premises are false. Or maybe they're just irrelevant to the conclusion. But don't pay any attention. 

Because, after all their conclusion, whether true or false, is unsupported by their argument. So, that's what a dismisser does. A dismisser, in short, is an argument to the effect that the person that you're attacking, hasn't successfully executed task two. That they have to perform whenever giving an argument. They might imply that certain premises support a conclusion on the issue, but they're wrong. Those premises don't actually support that conclusion. Maybe because they're false or maybe because they're irrelevant to the conclusion. 

Okay. Finally the third kind of ad hominem argument is called a denier. Now, a denier is an argument that begins with some premises about a person who's making a point, and ends with a conclusion to the affect that denies the conclusion of that other person's argument. In other words, whatever you have to say about their entitlement to speak on the issue, whatever you have to say about the truth of their premises or the relevance of their premises. A denier claims that the conclusion that they reach is false. 

So, a denier says that the person hasn't successfully executed task three that's associated with giving an argument. They claim that the conclusion is true, but their claim is wrong. 

Okay. So those are the three kind of ad hominem arguments corresponding to the three things that a person is doing whenever they're giving an argument. Next time, we're going to look in more detail, at each of those kinds of ad hominem arguments. In particular, next time, we'll examine silencer arguments, and then, we'll look at dismissers and deniers. See you next time. 

今天我们来谈谈一种特定的关联谬误 这种谬误被称作人身攻击论证（ad hominem argument） 如果通晓拉丁语的话 你们会知道这个词的意思是 针对个人的 但是人身攻击谬误是一种什么样的谬误呢 顾名思义 人生攻击谬误是指 人身攻击谬误始自这样的前提 某人在做论证 而终于这样的结论 批评那人的论证 而其对某人之论证的批评 仅仅建立在至于某人个人有关的前提上 

我来给诸位举个简单的例子 大家就明白我的意思了 假设Takahashi刚刚做了一番雄辩的说明 展示了许多证据 以证明如果美国与古巴正常化其邦交关系 将会为两国带来巨大的利益 如果美国与古巴正常化其邦交关系 两国都会获得经济上的进步 然后 在他之后 你可能就会反驳说  尽管Takahashi的展示非常雄辩 但他其实拥有雪茄进出口的生意 也就是说 他将是美古邦交正常化的受益方 因此 我们应当干脆无视Takahashi的展示 

好了 以上就是一个人身攻击论证的例子 对么 你的论证是以Takahashi本人为前提的 对么 也就是说 你攻击他是邦交正常化的得益方 所以无论他在其展示中给出什么样的证据 我们都不应当听取其结论 我们都不应该理会他的证据 因为无论如何 Takahashi是得益方 

好 以上就是一个人身攻击论证的例子 

我认为有三种人身攻击论证 是值得我们一一分辨的  这三种人身攻击论证分别对应人们正在做的三种不同的事 无论何时他们做出一个论证 让我们试想你在做论证时会做什么 好 当你在做论证时  我们假设你在向特定的观众做论证 好么 假设你在试图说服他们相信某事 

首先 你这样做就意味着  你有资格区提出 关于正在讨论之问题的看法 对么 那么 如果我正在进行一个论证 

就假设我是在论证 美国东南部诸州的放假 明年会上涨百分之十 

我在做论证时 这一行为本身意味着 我是有资格对此问题提出看法的 我有资格对之发表意见 也就是说我有对此问题发表意见 的必要的知识 对么 如果我对楼市及其走势是全然无知的 那么 我也就无法发表如上的意见 如果我对楼市之走势全然无知 那我也就没有任何立场来做如上论证 所以当我在做论证时 我的行为就表示我是有资格对此问题发表意见的 

我在做论证时 我的行为所表示的第二件事 就是特定的前提 也就是我在论证中所给出的那些前提 那时能够支持我所提出的结论的 对么 我所给出的那些前提 是真的 并且要与支持我所提的结论有关联 也许由这些前提而得出那些结论 乃是一个可靠地论证 也许只是近似较强的论证 但无论如何 前提都要支持结论 这是我做论证这个行为所表示的第二件事 

接下来 第三件事 当然啦 就是我声称我的结论为真 

以上就是无论何时 只要我在做论证 我就会做的事情 无论我想证明什么 我至少要做以上的三件事 而相应于每一件事 都有一种人身攻击论证与之对应 来否定我成功地履行了那件事 

好 让我们来看看这三种人身攻击论证 相应 好 第一种人身攻击论证我称之为消声式 

这种论证从这样的前提开始 这些前提是关于正在证明观点 正在做论证的人个人的 并结束于使我们无视其人之论证的结论 无论那人的论证是否可靠 也不管其结论是真是假 我们就是干脆不要关注其论证 对吧? 因为其人是没有资格对特定问题发表论证的 所以我们干脆就不要关心 其论证是否可靠 或其结论是真是假 因为其人根本就没有资格在此问题上发声 

这就是消声式所取得的效果 好么 那么 以上基本就是消声式论证 否定其人有对此问题发表观点的资格 否定其人成功履行了 其为了要证明一事为真而必须做到的事 

好 第二类人身攻击论证叫做摒弃式 摒弃式开始于这样的前提 亦即是有关正在说明观点 或正在做论证的人的前提 并结束于这样的观点 认为其人用于证明其观点的原因 都不是足够好的原因 

摒弃式并没有说论证者之推论中的结论是错误的 摒弃式只说 他们的原因是不够好的 所以就干脆不要关注他们的论证 因为他们所给出的支持他们结论的前提 事实上皆无法支持其结论 或许其前提本身 就是错误的 又或许前提与结论没什么关联 但是不管怎么说就是别关注 

因为 无论其结论是什么 是真是假 都是无法被其论证所支持的 那么 以上就是摒弃式的做法 简而言之 摒弃式是这样的一种论证 就是指责你所攻击的那个人并没有完成上述的第二个任务 而那是他们在做任何论证时都要做的事情 他们或许 提供了一些前提来支持 他们对特定问题的结论 但是他们错了 那些前提实际上并不真正支持其结论 因为前提本身为假 或者因为它们与结论无关 

好 最后一种人身攻击论证叫否定式 否定式开始于这样的前提 这些前提是关于 论证者本人的 并结束于否定别人的论证的结论 换言之 即便他们有资格对相关问题发言 即便他们的前提 的确与其结论有关系 否定式都宣城 他们的结论就是错的 

也就是说 否定式说 一个人没有履行 他做论证时所必须完成的第三个任务 他们宣称结论是正确的 但他们的结论是错的 

好 以上就是与人们在做论证时必须做的三件事 相对应的三种人身攻击论证 下一次我们会谈每一种人身攻击论证 的更多细节 特别是 下次我们首先要检验消声式论证 接着我们会看摒弃式与否定式 我们下次见。

### Silencers

In the last class, we talked about ad hominem arguments. And we distinguished three varieties of ad hominem arguments. 

Today we're going to talk about the first variety of those three, the variety that we call silencers. Now I should point out that while ad hominem arguments are typically fallacies, not all of them are fallacies. And the same holds true of silencers. While silencers are typically fallacies, not all of them are fallacies. So what I'm going to do today is first give a definition of silencers, then give some examples of silencers that are not fallacies. And finally, we'll talk about silencers that are fallacies, which are the most common kind of silencers. Okay, so first, what's a silencer? 

Well, a silencer is an ad hominem argument, that begins with some premises about a particular person, who's making a point. 

And it ends with a conclusion to the effect that we should disregard that person's argument all together. 

The conclusion is not the person's argument is an argument for a false conclusion, or their premises are false, or their premises don't support their conclusion. The conclusion is just, we shouldn't pay any attention to their argument at all. 

Now, I can give a couple of examples of silencers that are actually good arguments, that are not fallacies. But in order to give these examples I have to describe environments that tend to operate in a very strictly regulated framework. 

So, I'll start by giving some examples of silencers that are not fallacies, and then we'll look at silencers that are fallacies. So, first, here's a silencer that's not a fallacy. 

So suppose that you're in a court of law, during a criminal trial, and the accused is on the witness stand. The person who's accused of some heinous crimes is on the witness stand. Let's say the accused is has been accused of murder. 

And as always, the defense gets to call some witnesses and the prosecution gets to call some witnesses and there's a procedure that governs the progress of criminal trials. Right, criminal trials operate according to a certain procedure. Now, suppose that someone bursts into the room, someone who hasn't been called by either the defense or the prosecution, someone bursts into the room and then yells at the top of their lungs, I saw the accused murder the victim. Therefore, the accused is guilty of the crime with which she is charged. 

Okay, now this person who's just burst into the courtroom and presented this argument. 

This person might be presenting an argument that's sound, indeed it might be that the person saw the accused murder the victim. And it might be that the accused is guilty of the crime with which she is charged. 

So the argument that's being presented by the intruder, the person who bursts into the courtroom, might be a perfectly sound argument, 

but that doesn't mean we should listen to it. In fact, at least in American criminal trials, it's very likely that the judge would instruct the jury to disregard the outburst in the courtroom because that has not been presented as evidence by either the prosecution or the defense. Criminal trials have to operate according to a certain procedure. If the procedure is violated then a mistrial is declared. 

Or there has to be some way of fixing the violation of the procedure. And for someone to just burst in to the courtroom, not called there by either the prosecution or the defense, and to yell out that they saw the accused murder the victim, and therefore, the accused really is guilty of the crime with which he is charged. Well, the argument that they're giving might be sound, it might be the premise is true and the conclusion, and, of course, the premise supports the conclusion. But that doesn't mean we should listen to it. In fact the jury will very likely be specifically instructed to disregard the outburst. So there is an example of the silencer that is not a fallacy if I say the outburst was inappropriate and violates the procedure of the criminal trial therefore we should disregard it. 

Right. There I'm giving an argument. The argument is a silencer. It starts off with a premise about the person who made the outburst namely that their making the outburst was in violation of the procedure of the criminal trial and it ends with a conclusion to the effect that we should disregard their argument. So what I've just given right now is a silencer but that's a silencer that's actually a good argument. In that context we should ignore the outburst. 

Okay, or certainly the jury should ignore the outburst. 

Okay, so that's an example of a silencer that's not a fallacy. It's a good argument. Here's another example of a silencer that's not a fallacy. 

So suppose in a particular session of our national legislature, a bill, a proposed law is being debated by different legislators. And suppose someone bursts into the legislative assembly, and, makes the following outburst. This bill will throw millions of working citizens into dire poverty. Any bill that throws millions of working citizens into dire poverty should not be passed into law, and therefore this bill should not be passed into law. Now again, it's possible, let's suppose, that the argument that this person is giving is a sound argument. It's possible that the premises are both true and that the conclusion is true. And that the premises support the conclusion. 

But even if it's a sound argument, given the way legislative sessions are supposed to operate, we shouldn't listen to the argument that this person has given, because the way they gave it violates the protocol of legislative sessions. Right, so I might argue as follows. I might say, this person's outburst violates the protocol of our legislative session, therefore we must disregard their argument. 

That's an example of a silencer. 

And yet, it's not a bad argument. It very well might be true, given the rules governing legislative activity, that we do need to disregard this outburst. That doesn't mean that we don't need to think about the considerations that the person adduced. We might need to think about the considerations that the person adduced. But that would be for other reasons than that the person that adduced them. So this is an example of a silencer that's actually a good argument. It's a good argument for the conclusion that we should ignore the outburst that the person made into the legislative session. 

Okay, so now I've given a couple of examples of silencers that are good arguments. 

But notice, these silencers occur in very special circumstances, let's say, during a criminal trial or during a legislative session. During some occasion that's governed by a bunch of procedural rules and regulations. 

But ordinary life isn't like that. In ordinary life, our conversations aren't governed by that thick network of procedural rules and regulations. Of course, there are rules and regulations that govern ordinary conversation, rules and regulations concerning etiquette, you know, being reasonably polite and considerate to one another. Those rules and regulations are few enough and far between that we still leave room for people outside our conversation to burst out with consideration. 

But those regulations are not as many and not as complicated as the rules and regulations that govern 

legal proceedings and legislative sessions. In ordinary life when do we encounter silencers? Well, often we encounter silencers of a following form. We will encounter a silencer to the effect that we shouldn't listen to someone's argument, because after all, that person has a criminal record. Or we shouldn't listen to someone's argument, because after all, that person is a philanderer. Or we shouldn't listen to someone's argument, because after all, we all know what that person is like. That person is, that person's just weird and so we just shouldn't listen to their argument. 

So, often in ordinary life we encounter silencers that are fallacies. They tell us not to listen to the argument that a person is giving, not because that argument, the act that they performed of giving that argument, violates the strict rules and regulations governing our proceedings. We shouldn't listen to their argument because that person is weird, or that person has a, has some event in their history that should make us look askance at them. 

Now, those silencers typically are fallacies and yet those are the kinds of silencers that we find most commonly in everyday life. 

Okay. So, that's our discussion of silencers. Next time, we'll talk about dismissers. See you next time. 

上节课我们讨论了诉诸人身论证 我们也区分了它的三个种类 

今天我们要讨论的是第一种 也就是 消声式 现在我要指出的是 尽管诉诸人身论证往往是 谬误 但并不是所有都是谬误 消声式也是同样的情况 虽然消声式通常是一种谬误 但这也并不是所有情况下都是成立的 因此今天我要做的首先是给消声式 下一个定义 接着举一些消声式不是谬误的例子 最后 我们讨论一下是谬误的消声式的例子 这些是消声式最普遍的一种情况 好 首先 什么是消声式？ 

消声式是一种诉诸人身论证 它以 一些前提开始 这些前提有关于一个特定的提出某个观点的人的 

然后以一个以达到所有人应当无视这个人的论证的效果 的结论为结束 

这个结论并不是要说明这个人的论证的结论是错误的 不是要说明这个论证的前提是错误的 也不是要说明论证的前提不支持结论 这个结论仅仅是 我们不能对他们的论证予以任何关注 

现在 我可以给你们一些例子 在这些例子中 消声式的的确确是非常好的论证 它们不是谬误 但是为了给出这些例子 我必须描述一下环境 这些使得消声式成立的环境有着非常严格的限制条件 

我们先从消声式不是谬误的例子开始举例 然后再来看看是谬误的消声式 所以 首先 这里有一个消声式不是谬误的事例 

假设你正在一个法庭上旁观 一个刑事诉讼 被告者正在证人席上 这个犯下了极其恶劣罪行的人正在证人席上 我们假设被告被指控谋杀 

像往常一样地 辩护人传唤证人 原告 传唤证人 这里有 一个刑事诉讼审判的流程 好 刑事诉讼依照一定的流程晶型 现在 假设有人冲进了这个房间 这个人 并没有被辩护方或者起诉方传唤 有个人冲进了房间 竭尽全力 大喊 我看见被告谋杀了受害者 所以 被告 是负有她被指控的这项罪名的 

好了 现在这个人刚刚冲进了 法庭 并且表达了他的论证 

这个人可能是在表达一个确凿的论述 事实上 可能是那个人看见了被告杀了受害者 有可能被告是负有她被指控的罪名的 

因此闯入者 这个冲进法庭的人陈述的 这个论证 可能是一个极其确凿的论证 

但这不意味着我们就应该听取他的论述 事实上 至少在美国的刑事审判中  法官很可能建议陪审团不要理会 这个闯入者 因为这没有被 起诉方或者辩护方当作证据展示 刑事审判必须依照一定的流程执行 如果流程被破坏了 就会被宣布 无效审判 

或者必须有一些可以修复被破坏的流程的方法 对于刚刚闯入法庭的人 他并没有 被起诉方或辩护方传唤 嚷着说 被告谋杀了受害者 因此 被告的的确确是负有她被指控的这项罪名的 他们给出的这个论证可能是可靠的 前提和结论 都可能是正确的 当然 前提也支持结论 但是这并不意味这我们就应该听取它 事实上陪审团很可能特别之处不要关注 闯入者 所以这是一个消声式 不是谬误的事例 如果我说闯入者是不合时宜的 并且打断刑事审判流程了 所以我们应该无视它 

对吧 现在我要给出一个论证 这个论证是一个消声式 它的前提是某个人指出 闯入者干扰了 刑事审判的流程 结论是 要达到我们应该无视闯入者的论证的效果 那么 我刚刚给出的论证是一个消声式 但这个消声式是一个好的论证 在那样的背景之下我们就应该无视闯入者 

好吧 或者是陪审团应该无视闯入者 

好了 这是一个消声式不是谬误的例子 这是一个好的论证 这里有另一个消声式的例子 这个例子也不是谬误 

假设在国家立法会议的一个 特定一节当中 一个提案 一个被提议的 法案正在接受议员们的辩论 假如有个人闯进了 议会大厅 发表了如下意见 这个提案将会导致数百万计的工薪阶层陷入极端贫困当中 任何一个将导致 几百万工薪阶层陷入贫困的提案都不应该通过 而成为法律 因此这个提案应该被否决 再一次地 有可能 让我们 假设 这个人给出的论证是可靠的 有可能这两个前提都是真的而且结论也是真的 而且前提支持结论 

但即使它是个可靠的论证 考虑到 立法会议的运作方式 我们也不应该听取 这个人给出的论证 因为 他给出论证的方式扰乱了立法会议的流程 好 那么我可能会像下面这样论证 我可能说 这个闯入者说的话扰乱了 立法会议的流程 所以我们应该无视他的论证 

这是消声式的一个例子 

同样 它不是一个坏的论证 它有极大的可能是正确的 考虑到立法行为 应当遵循的法则 我们的确要无视这个闯入者的言论 那并不意味这我们不需要考虑 这个人举出的例子 我们可能需要考虑这个人说的东西 但是那应该出于别的原因 而不是因为这个人说了这些 所以这是一个消声式事实上是一个好论证的例子 对于结论也就是我们应该无视立法会议闯入者的言论来说 这 是一个好的论证 

好了 现在我已经给出了一些 消声式是好论证的例子 

但是请注意 这些消声式出现在非常特殊的境况下  比如说 出现在一个刑事审判或者立法会议中 在某些受不同流程规则和规范约束的场合之中 

但是日常生活不像这样 在日常生活中 我们的对话不会被这些沉重的 流程规则和规范框架所约束 当然 日常对话也有它们的 礼节上的规则和规范 你知道的 对对方要有一定的 礼貌 要适当体贴周全 这些规则和规范是如此地少 我们仍旧留有 空间给那些我们对话外的人插话进来 

但是这些规范不如控制 立法过程和立法会议的那些规则规范 

那样多且复杂 在日常生活中我们什么时候会遇到消声式？ 好吧 通常我们会遇到的消声式遵循以下这种形式 我们会遇到的消声式想要达到的效果是 我们不应该听从 某人的论证 因为毕竟这个人有犯罪记录 或者我们不应该听取某人的论证 因为 因为这个人变化无常 或者我们不应该听某个人的论证 毕竟 我们都知道这个人是个什么样的人 这个人就是非常奇怪的一个人 所以我们就不应该听他说的话 

因此 在平常生活中我们遇到的消声式往往是谬误的 它们告诉我们不要听从某个人的论证 不是因为这个论证或是给出论证的行为方式 破坏了我们正在进行的行为的严格的规范法则 我们不应该相信听取他们的论证是因为 那个人很怪异 或者那个人 过去发生过某件事情以至于我们戴着有色眼镜去看待他 

那些消声式 很典型地是谬误 那些也是 我们在日常生活中最容易发现的消声式的种类 

好 以上是我们关于消声式的讨论 下节课我们将讨论摒弃式 下节课再见 

### Dismissers

In the last class, we talked about an ad hominem argument called a silencer. And we said that while there are some silencers that are good arguments, a lot of them given in every day life are bad arguments. They're fallacies. Today I want to talk about another kind of ad hominem argument. An ad hominem argument called a dismisser. I want to say what dismissers are. I want to give some examples of dismissers that actually are pretty good arguments, but then I want to give some examples of dismissers that occur in every day life that are bad arguments. Okay. So, let's start by defining what dismissers are. So, 

as I said, a dismisser is a kind of ad hominem argument. It begins with premises about a particular person who's making a point, and it ends with a conclusion. To the effect that that person's reasons for that point are not good reasons, right? So, a dismisser is not a silencer. It's not saying that the person has no right to speak about the issue. It's not saying that we should just disregard anything they have to say about the issue. Fine, they're entitled to speak about the issue. Maybe we should listen to what they have to say about the issue, but we should not regard the reasons that they gave as good reasons. That's the point of a dismisser. Now, as I said there are some dismissers that are good arguments. Let's consider a couple of examples. 

First, consider the following argument, right. Let's suppose we've just watch an advertisement, in which a coalition of companies in the fossil fuel industry are, giving an argument, in the ad, to the effect that climate change is a hoax. In fact that there, in fact there's no significant man-made climate change taking place in the environment today. Now, we might argue as follows. 'Kay, premise, the fossil fuel industry is eager to operate under as little environmental regulation as possible. That's true of all companies that are interested in turning a profit. 

Conclusion. Therefore, any reason that the members of the fossil fuel industry give in support of the conclusion that climate change is a hoax are unlikely to provide strong support for that conclusion. 

Okay, now, that argument, I claim, is a good one. It's a dismisser where you're arguing from the interests of the fossil fuel industry. To the conclusion that we should take whatever reasons they give in defence of their conclusion that climate change is a hoax. We should take those reasons with a grain of salt, we should be suspicious of them. Now, of course, that's not to say for a moment that we should simply deny those reasons or deny the conclusion that climate change is a hoax. That's a substantive question that requires climatological expertise to answer. 

But, while we leave it open as a possibility that the argument being made by members of the fossil fuel industry is in fact a sound argument. We only leave it open as a possibility. We recognize that what's very likely to be true given their interest is that the argument that they are making is not a good argument. Possibly it is. We have to investigate. But based on what we know now about the interests of the fossil fuel industry, it very likely is not a good argument. 

Okay. So, let's give another example of a dismisser that's a good argument. 

Let's suppose the head of a particular bureaucracy is arguing that cuts to that bureaucracy's operating budget would be absolutely devastating. In fact, given the centrality of that bureaucracy's mission, it's in fact crucial that they're operating budget be at least maintained, and preferably, significantly grown. Okay, now we might give the following dismisser argument. We might say look, the head of that bureaucracy is eager to have as large an operating budget as possible under her control. That's her job, is to gather as many resources as possible and harness them in the service of whatever purposes she sets out to achieve. 

But from that, we could draw the conclusion that any reasons that she gives in support of the conclusion that her department, her bureaucracy, needs to maintain or grow its current budget. Those reasons are unlikely to provide strong support for that conclusion. Again, that leaves it open. Perhaps the conclusion is true. Perhaps even the reasons provide strong support for that conclusion. And certainly, she's entitled to have an opinion on the issue, she's entitled to sound off on the issue. 

But we should be suspicious. Of her argument, given the interest that she has, given her powerful personal interest in increasing the size of her operating budget, we should be very suspicious of the reasons that she gives. We should assume that they're false, unless we have good reason to believe that they're true. We should assume that they don't support her conclusion, unless we have good reason to believe that they do. 

Okay, so these are some examples of dismisser ad hominem arguments, that are actually pretty good arguments. 

But more often than not, dismissers are given in everyday life That are not good arguments, that are fallacies. We might dismiss someone's reasons for a particular conclusion, not because we detect that that person's own interests, let's say, their professional interests or their financial interests. Determined that they would give this argument in favor of this conclusion. But rather because that person has some feature that maybe we don't like. 

maybe we think they're too smart by half or maybe there's something about them, strikes us as suspicious. We can't quite put our finger on it but Maybe they just seem vaguely, I don't know, European. Something like that. We, we on account of that feature we suspect that whatever argument they're giving is not a good argument. Okay. Those are examples of dismissers that are fallacies. Let's consider some examples of those now. 

上节课 我们讨论了有关消音式诉诸人身论证的内容 我们讲过虽然有些消音式论证是正确的论证 但是在日常生活中许多消音式论证却是错误的论证 它们是谬误 今天我想谈谈另一种诉诸人身 论证 这种论证称为摒弃式 我想来谈谈什么是摒弃式 我先举一些忽视令的例子 论证的例子 然后我想举一些在日常生活中 出现的错误的摒弃式论证的例子 好 那么 我们从摒弃式的定义开始谈起 目前为止 我的想法是所以 

如我所说 摒弃式是诉诸人身论证的一种类型 排除令的前提是某人在 的某个人 然后得出一个结论 以此来达到说明那个人 不是好理由 对吧？ 所以 忽视令和消声令是不同的 摒弃式并不是要说那个人对这件事没有发言权 重要的不仅仅是最终的结果 说我们应该忽略他们对此事的任何说辞 好吧 他们有资格对次事发言 也许我们是应该听听他们对这件事的看法 但是我们不应该把他们给出的理由视作好的理由 这就是忽视令的定义 如我所说 有一些忽视令是好的论证 我们来看几个例子 

首先 看下面的论证 假设我们刚看完一个 广告 广告中一个化石燃料企业公司的联盟 论证 气候变化是个骗局 事实上如今并没有发生任何显著的 人为造成的气候变化 现在 我们会论证如下 好吧 前提是 化石燃料公司希望 规范其运营的环境法规越少越好 这对于所有想盈利的公司都是正确的 

结论 因此 化石燃料工业界的成员所给出的 支持环境变化是个骗局这个结论的 气候变化是个骗局这个结论的理由  给这个结论提供强有力的支持 

好吧 现在 我认为这个论证 是个好的论证 这是个摒弃式论证 因为你从化石燃料企业的利益出发来论证  推断出结论 就是我们应当认为无论他们给出什么理由  关于气候变化是个骗局的结论的任何理由 我们应该对那些理由持怀疑态度 我们应该对它们怀有疑虑 当然 这不是说我们可以暂时 简单地否认这些理由或者是否认气候变化是个骗局这个结论 这是个需要气象学专业知识 才能回答的实质性问题 

但是 当我们保留这个论证的可能性不下定论 化石燃料 企业的成员们做出的论证事实上是个合理的论证 我们也仅仅是保留了这个可能性 我们认识到 考虑到他们的利益  他们做出的论证 极有可能不是个好的论证 这是可能的 我们需要进一步研究 但是基于我们对化石燃料企业 利益的了解 这极有可能 不是个好的论证 

好 那么 我们来看一个合理的摒弃式论证的例子 

我们假设某个官僚机构的 首脑辩论说 缩减该机构的 运营预算是毁灭性的的 事实上 考虑到该官僚机构任务的中心 维持他们的经费预算 不变 或者更好地 有大幅度增长 是至关重要的 好 现在我们可能作出如下的摒弃式论证 我们可能说 看 这个官僚机构的首脑 急切希望在她的控制下有尽可能多的 预算经费 这是她的本职工作 集合尽可能多的资源并 利用它们达到她想达到的任何目的 

但是由此出发 我们可以得出结论 她给出的任何用来支持这个结论的理由  也就是用来作为她的部门 她所在的官僚机构 需要维持或提高现有预算 这些理由都不能有力地 支持这个结论 再一次 我们假设这样的可能性 有可能这个结论是正确的 甚至这些理由确实能有力地支持结论 并且显然 她有权利对这件事 发表看法 她有权利对这件事力陈己见 

但是我们应当对她的论证 表示怀疑 考虑到她得到的 利益 考虑到提高经费预算 她能得到的巨大的个人利益 我们应该 对于她给出的理由表示非常 怀疑 我们应当假设 它们是错误的 除非我们有充分的理由 相信它们是正确的 我们应当假定这些理由不能支持她的结论 除非我们有足够的理由相信它们可以支持她的结论 

好了 所以这就是一些关于摒弃式 诉诸人身论证的例子 它们事实上是合理的论证 

但是更多情况下 日常生活中的 摒弃式论证不是合理的论证 它们是谬误 可能我们之所以摒弃了某人对 一个特定结论给出的理由 并不是因为我们觉察到那个人的 个人利益 比如说 他们的职业或是经济利益 而断定他们会给出对这个结论有利的理由 而是因为那个人有一些我们可能不喜欢的特点 

有可能我们认为他们太聪明了 或是 或是可能他们的某一些方面让我们觉得可疑 我们不能找出确切的理由但是 可能他们只是看起来隐隐约约 我也不知道 看起来像欧洲人 大概就是这样 我们由于这个特点的缘故 从而怀疑他们作出的任何论证都不是合理的论证 好 这是一些成为谬误的摒弃式论证的例子 现在我们来讨论一些这样的例子 

### Deniers

In the last two lectures we talked about two different kinds of ad hominem arguments. They were silencers and dismissers. In this lecture we're going to talk about the third and final kind of ad hominem argument that we'll be discussing in this course. these are called deniers. So, let's start off with the definitions of deniers. And then, we'll give some examples of deniers that actually are good arguments, followed by some examples of deniers that are fallacies. Okay so first, what's a denier? 

Well, a denier is a kind of ad hominem argument that begins with premises about a particular person who's making a point, right, that's what makes it an ad hominem, and it ends with a conclusion denying the point that that person is making, denying the conclusion of that persons argument. It's not saying the person isn't authorized or entitled to speak on the issue. It's not saying that the reasons the person presents in favor of their conclusion are somehow defective, false, insufficiently supportive of the conclusion. Rather it's saying, independently of any of that, the conclusion is false. The conclusion that that person is coming to is false. So that's how a denier works. Let me give you some examples of deniers that are actually good arguments. 

So here's one. Suppose that Arthur performs the following speech act. I, I don't know why Arthur would do this but let's just suppose he does. He says I am an inveterate liar, and most the time I speak falsely, including now. Therefore, this very statement is false. 

Okay, now, if that's what Arthur says, then we can conclude that the point that Arthur is making, the conclusion that Arthur is drawing from his argument is not true. 

Alright, because the conclusion that he's drawing from his argument is, this very statement is false. 

But the problem is, if it's true that this very statement is false, then that means that that statement really is false. In which case, it's not true. 

So, it can't be true that this very statement is false. In other words, Arthur's conclusion, the conclusion that Arthur reaches at the end of his argument, is not true. 

Now we just proved that. So, we just proved that by thinking about the performance that Arthur gave where he was making a speech act with that content. He said, I am an inveterate liar, most of the time I speak falsely, even now. Therefore this very statement is false. When Arthur says that we can prove that the conclusion that he's reaching is not true. So there's an example of a denier. It starts with a premise about a particular person, in this case, Arthur, and it's a premise about what Arthur does, and it ends with a conclusion to the effect that the conclusion that Arthur drew is not true. So it denies the conclusion that Arthur drew. 

So there's an example of a denier ad hominem argument. But that argument actually is a good one. It Arthur issues that particular verbal performance, then the conclusion that he draws is not true. 

Okay, so there's an example of a denier that's a good argument. Here's another example of a denier that's a good argument. Suppose that Cybil is arguing in front of, let's say, her university's Honor Court, that her classmate Susan cheated on some exam that both Cybil and Susan took. 

Now I might argue as follows. look into her argument. Cybil did provide a lot of evidence that Susan cheated on the exam. 

but though Cybil's evidence may seem compelling, in fact Cybil hereself is an unrepentant cheater, who repeatedly tries to hide her tracks. She tries to disguise her cheating planting evidence of cheating on innocent classmates. 

Therefore, I conclude Cybil's conclusion itself to the effect that Susan cheated, Cybil's conclusion is probably not true. 

Susan probably did not cheat. Despite the evidence that Cybil has presented against here. Because Cybil does have this track record of planting evidence on innocent classmates. 

Okay, there also is an example of a denier argument. It starts with a premise about a particular person, in this case Cybil. And, it ends with a conclusion to the effect that Cybil's own conclusion is false, or at least probably false. 

So, it doesn't say Cibyl isn't authorized to speak on the issue of cheating, it doesn't say that Cibyl's evidence doesn't support her conclusion, it just says that regardless of. Cibyl's entitlement to speak on the issue and the support that her evidence lends to her conclusion. Her conclusion is false, or at least probably false. So that's another example of a denier argument, and there again we have a denier argument that seems like a pretty good argument. 

It's not deductively valid. 

But it's a pretty strong argument nonetheless. It's a strong inductive argument nonetheless. Okay, so those are examples of good denier arguments. 

But we have to search far and wide to find examples of good denier arguments. What we find more often, especially when we look through the media, are examples of bad denier arguments. Denier arguments in which we conclude that someone else's argument leads to a false conclusion, and we draw that conclusion based on features of the person that are really irrelevant to the truth of the conclusion that they're arguing for. We'll see some examples of that right now. 

在之前的两节课里我们谈了 两种不同的付诸人身论证形式 消声式和摒弃式 在这节课中 我们将要探讨的式第三种也是最后一种 我们在这门课中将要讨论的诉诸人身论证形式 也就是否定式论证 我们将先给出否定式论证的定义 然后 我们将将给出一些 否定式论证为合理论证的例子 随后 我们将给出否定式论证为谬误的例子 那么 首先 什么是否定式论证 

否定式论证是一种付诸人身的论证 它从一些关于这个正在表明观点的人的前提出发 因此它是诉诸人身的 然后它由此得出全盘否认 那个人正在论述的观点的结论 否认 那个人的论证结论 这不是说那个人 没有权利 来谈论相关问题 这也并不是说 该论证者的论述理由 是有缺陷的 错误的 不足以有效地支持 结论的成立 而是说 不管如上任何一点 该论证者的结论就是错的 该论证者得到的结论就是 错误的 这就是否定式的论证方式 下面让我来给你们一些 否定式论证是合理论证的例子 

听好 比方说 Arthur说了如下的话 （见图中） 我不知道他为什么要这么说 但是 我们假设他就是这么做了 他说我是一个撒谎老手 我一直都在说谎 包括现在也是 因此 我刚说的这句话也是假的”  

现在 如果 Arthur这么说了 那么我们可以得出结论 Arthur从他的论证中得出的结论 从他自己的论证中得出的结论是不对的 

因为他从他的论证中得出的结论就是 ”我刚说的这句话也是假的“ 

但是问题在于 如果 Arthur的结论“我刚说的这句话也是假的”是真的 那就意味Arthur所说的”我是个撒谎高手“这个论述的确是假的 但是 这不是事实 

因此 ”我刚说的这句话也是假的“不可能是真的 换句话说 Arthur的结论 Aurther在他的论证之后 是不对的 

现在我们刚刚证明了这一点 我们刚刚证明了这一点通过考虑 Arthur在言语行为表现 他说： “我是一个撒谎老手 大多数时间我都在撒谎 包括现在： 因此 我刚刚说的话也是假的” 当Arthur 这么说的时候 我们可以证明Arthur 所得出的结论是不对的 这就是一个否定式论证的例子 它从一些关于某个特定的人的前提出发 在我们的例子中 这个人就是Arthur 而这个关于Arthur的前提就是 Arthur是个撒谎老手 然后它得出结论 Arthur所得出的结论都是假的 即 它否认了Arthur所得出的结论 

因此 这就是一个否认式诉诸人身论证 然后如上例子中的论证实际上是合理的 如果Arthur真的那么说了的话 那么 那么他所得出的结论是不对的 

因此 这是一个否定式论证为合理论证的例子 下面是另一个否定式论证为合理论证的例子 比方说 Cybil在她的学校荣誉法庭上控诉 她的同学Susan在一门 Cybil和Susan都参加了的考试中作弊了 

我们来看如下的论证 图中即论证过程 （1）Cybil提供很多证明Susan在考试中作弊的证据 

（2）虽然Cybil的证据看上去很有力 但实际上 Cybil自己本身就经常作弊 她经常试图隐藏她作弊的痕迹 她经常通过栽赃无辜的同学 来隐藏自己的作弊行为 

由此 我得出结论 Cybil的关于Susan作弊的结论 很有可能是不对的 

Susan很有可能并没有作弊 即便Cybil出示了很多证据来证明Susan作弊了 但是因为Cybil有 栽赃无辜同学的案底记录 

好 这是另一个否定式论证的例子 它从一些关于某个人的前提的开始 在这个例子中 这个人是Cybil 然后它得出结论Cybil的论证结论 是错的，至少很有可能是错的 

它并没有说Cybil无权 参与关于作弊的话题 它也没有说Cybil的证据 不支持她的结论 它仅仅说是 不管 Cybil参与这个问题的权利 和 她的证据对于她的结论的支持 她的论证结论都是假的 或者至少 很有可能是假的 因此这是另一个否定式论证的例子 同样的 这个否定式论证看上去也是 一个相当合理的论证 

虽然不是演绎有效的 

但是依然是一个相当有力的论证 它依然是一个有力的归纳式论证 这些是合理的否定式论证的例子 

但是我们必须很努力才能找到 这个合理的 否定式论证的例子 而我们经常可以看到的 尤其是 在媒体上 看到的往往是 不合理的否定式论证的例子 否定式论证就是我们认定某人的结论是不对的 得到的是错误的结论 而我们是根据 这个人的一些与所讨论的结论的真实性 完全无关的特征中 得出的结论 我们将很快看到一些这样的例子 敬请期待 

## Appeals to Authority

### Appeals to Authority

In the last few lectures we've been looking at the varieties of ad hominem argument. And in particular, we've looked at a bunch of examples of ad hominem fallacies and the different kinds of ad hominem fallacies. Today, I want to start on a new but related topic. The new topic is appeals to authority. So, first let me define appeals to authority, and make it clear precisely how appeals to authority are related to ad hominem arguments. So first, what's an appeal to authority? 

So, an appeal to authority is a kind of argument that begins with premises about a particular person who's making a claim, and ends with a conclusion that endorses that person's claim. In a way, you could think of an appeal to authority as the opposite of an ad hominem argument. Right? Remember, an ad hominem argument is one that starts with premises about a particular person who's making a claim and then ends with a conclusion that is opposed to that person's claim. In an appeal to authority, you start with the same sorts of premises, but you end with a conclusion that is in favor of that person's claim. 

Okay so here's an example of an appeal to authority. It's a particularly egregious example not one that anyone would be consciously guilty of making but still an example to give us the rough idea. 

So, premise one, Takahashi has just given an eloquent presentation of evidence that normalizing US relations with Cuba will result in benefit to both nations. Premise two, Takahashi's presentation was extremely eloquent, and she was very well dressed. Conclusion, we should accept Takahashi's conclusion, to the effect that normalizing relations between the United States and Cuba will result in benefit to both countries. 

Okay. So that's an example of an appeal to authority. It's an argument that begins with premises about a particular person, in this case, premises about how eloquent Takahashi was and how well dressed she was. Right, so we start off with premises like that and we end with a conclusion, so we should believe her. We should accept her conclusion because, after all, she was so well dressed and eloquent. Okay, now, as I said, that's a very egregious example of an appeal to authority, but appeals to authority all have that structure. They start with premises about a particular person, and they end with a conclusion to the effect that what that person said is especially credible, should get special weight. 

Okay. 

So, appeals to authority, like ad hominem arguments, come in three kinds corresponding to the three jobs that someone is doing whenever they give an argument or whenever they try to prove a point. Remember, the three things that someone is doing whenever they give an argument or try to prove a point are these. First, they're implying that they are entitled to put forth claims about the issue. Right. If I'm putting forth claims about an issue then my behavior implies that I'm entitled to do so. 

Second the person who's putting forth claims about an issue is making an argument about an issue is implying that the premises that they're giving actually do support the conclusion that they're drawing. Right? I wouldn't be giving certain premises in support of my conclusion unless I believe that those premises really did support that conclusion. So, for me to give certain premises in support of a conclusion is to imply that those premises really do support that conclusion. I might not be saying that the premises support that conclusion, but my behavior clearly implies that I think so. 

Okay, finally of course, when you give an argument in favor of a certain conclusion, you're claiming that the conclusion is true. That's part of the point of arguing for a conclusion, you're trying to prove the conclusion, establish it, claim that it's true. 

Okay, well, corresponding to these three things that people do when they give arguments, there are three different kinds of appeals to authority that we can make, all right? We can make a kind of appeal to authority that I call an amplifier. An amplifier is an argument that begins with premises about a particular person who is making a point and ends with a conclusion to the effect that we should place great weight, or place great credence on the point that the person is making. Right, that that person is somehow especially entitled to speak on the issue. That they have some special authority that makes their argument deserving of our attention. That's an amplifier. Or we could give an appeal to authority argument that I call a supporter. A supporter is an argument that begins with premises about a particular person who is making a point, and ends with a conclusion to the effect that the reasons that the person is giving in support of their point are especially compelling reasons. 

And finally, there's a kind of appeal to authority that I call an affirmer. 

When you give an affirmer, you're giving an argument that begins with premises about a particular person who is making a point, and you end with a conclusion that affirms the point that person is making. A conclusion that supports that persons conclusion. Insists that that persons conclusion is true or at least very probably true. 

Okay, so these are three different kinds of appeals to authority and again they correspond just as the three different kinds of ad hominem argument corresponded to the three different things that some one is doing when they give an argument. Right, the three different kinds of ad hominem argument with three different ways of arguing that the person who is making a point hadn't successfully executed one of these three jobs. The three different kinds of appeals to authority are three different ways of arguing that a particular person who's making an argument has successfully executed one or another of these three different jobs. Okay. So those are the three kinds of appeals to authority. 

In the next lecture, we'll talk about amplifiers. We'll give some examples of amplifiers. That are good arguments, and then some examples of amplifiers which, occurring more routinely, are bad arguments. Okay, see you next time. 

在前几课中 我们已经看过了人身攻击论证的几种类型 尤其是人身攻击谬误的一些例子 以及不同种类的人身攻击谬误 今天我要开始一个全新但有关联的话题 它就是诉诸权威 首先我们来定义一下诉诸权威 并且明确弄清诉诸权威是如何与人身攻击产生关联的 首先 什么是诉诸权威 

诉诸权威是这样一种论证 它的前提是某人提出其主张 结论是同意这个人的主张 在某种程度上 你可以把诉诸权威看成是 人身攻击论证的对立面 对吧 记住 人身攻击论证是 以某人提出主张为前提 然而结论是 反对这个人的主张 在诉诸权威中 你的前提是同种类型的 但结论却是支持这个人的主张 

好 下面是一个诉诸权威的例子 这是一个异乎寻常的例子 并不是任何人 都会意识到犯错 但它仍然能给我们展现粗略的概念 

前提一 Takahashi刚刚做了一番有说服力的演说 证明美国与古巴关系的常态化会使双方受益 前提二 Takahashi的演说非常有说服力 而且她打扮得体 结论 我们应该接受Takahashi的结论 那就是美国与古巴关系的常态化 会带来使双方受益的效果 

好 这就是一个诉诸权威的例子 它是这样一种论证 以关于某人的前提出发 在这个例子中 就是Takahashi多么有说服力 以及她的穿着多么得体 好 我们以这样的前提开始 然后得出结论 所以我们应该相信她 我们应该接受她的结论因为 她毕竟穿着得体又有说服力 好 现在 就像我说的 这是一个 关于诉诸权威的不同寻常的例子 不过诉诸权威的结构通常如此 他们从关于某人的前提出发 然后得到结论 那就是 这个人说的话非常可信 应该有一定的分量 

好 

诉诸权威 就像人身攻击论证一样 有三种类型 分别对应人们在论证 或者是试图证明某事时 做出的三种行为 记住 人们在论证 或者是试图证明某事时 或者是试图证明某事时 做出的三种行为如下 第一 暗示他们有资格 就该议题提出主张 对吧 如果我就某个议题提出主张 那么我的行为暗示了我有资格这样做 

第二 那个提出主张的人是在对该议题做出论证 他在暗示他给出的前提 实际上能够支持他作出的结论 对吧? 我不会提供前提来支持我的结论 除非我相信这些前提确实能支持结论 所以 对我来说 给出某些前提来支持一个结论 就暗示了那些前提确实能支持那个结论 我也许没有说那些前提能支持结论 但是我的行为明白地暗示了我是这样认为的 

好 最后一点 当然 当你的论证是支持某个结论时 你就在宣称这个结论是正确的 这就是通过论证得出结论的意义之一 你在尝试着证明这个结论 确定它 宣称它是正确的 

好 对应于这三种人们在论证时作出的行为 人们在论证时作出的行为 有三种不同类型的诉诸权威 对吧 有一种诉诸权威叫做夸大式 强化令是这样一种论证 它的前提是某人提出一个观点 结论是我们应该重视 且信任这个人的观点 好 这个人莫名其妙对该议题有发言的资格 他们拥有某些特殊的权威 使得他们的论证值得我们注意 这就是强化令 另一种诉诸权威的论证叫做支持式 支持式是这样一种论证 它的前提是某人提出一个观点 结论是这个人 用以支持观点的理由是令人信服的 

最后一种诉诸权威叫做证实式 

证实式是这样一种论证 它的前提是某人提出一个观点 结论是 证实这个人的观点 即你的结论就是支持这个人的结论 坚持这个人的结论 是正确的 或至少极可能是正确的 

好 这就是三种不同类型的 诉诸权威 他们分别对应 人们在论证时作出的三种行为 就像人身攻击与它们的对应一样 好 三种不同的人身攻击论证 以三种不同方式 论证这个人提出的观点 不能成功实行这三种行为 三种不同的诉诸权威 以三种不同的方式论证了 某人作出的论证能够 成功实施这三种行为之一 好 这就是三种不同类型的诉诸权威 

在下节课中 我们将讨论夸大式 将给出夸大式的一些 那些是好的论证 其中一些 更常规的 是差的论证 好的 下次见 

### Amplifiers

In the last class we distinguished three kinds of appeals to authority and today I want to talk about the first of those three kinds, a kind of argument that we'll call amplifiers. What's an amplifier? We'll define it, and then we'll consider a couple of examples. First we'll consider examples of amplifiers that are actually good arguments, and then we'll look at some amplifiers that are bad arguments. Okay, so first, here's the definition. What's an amplifier? An amplifier is an argument that begins with premises about a particular person who's making a point, and it ends with a conclusion to the effect that we should place great weight or lend great credence to the person's point right? Whatever the person is saying, they have a special entitlement. They're especially authoritative to say it. 

Okay, so that's an amplifier. 

Now, I said sometimes amplifier are good arguments To see an example of a couple of amplifiers, both of which are good arguments, I'd like you to look at the following clip. >> And the funny part of it is, Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's work. >> Oh really? Really? I happen to teach a class at Columbia called TV, Media, and Culture. I think that my insights into Mr. McCluen, well, have a great deal of validity. >> Oh do you? >> Okay. Now, in that clip, we saw a person who was a Columbia University professor arguing as follows, implicitly arguing as follows. 

I teach a class on media and popular culture at Columbia University. 

Therefore, you should lend great credence to my views on the issues of which I speak. That seemed to be the argument that the person was making. That's why he brought up the fact that he teaches a class on media and popular culture at Columbia University, in order to lend credence to his views on the topic. Okay. Now, it's true that if someone is a Columbia University professor who teaches a particular topic, that does tend to establish some credibility that they might have on that topic. But while that might be a good amplifier argument, it doesn't prove that its conclusion is true, and to see that it doesn't prove, not conclusively anyway, that its conclusion is true, we need to look at the rest of that clip and consider another amplifier argument that occurs in the rest of that clip. Right here. >> Because I happen to have Mr. McCluen right here. So, so, here, just let me, let me, come over here a second. Tell him. >> I heard what you were saying. You, you know nothing of my work. You mean my whole fallacy is wrong. How you ever got to teach a course in anything is totally amazing. >> Boy, if life were only like this. >> Okay. So what's happening there? What's happening there is that Marshall McLuhan himself appears. Now, Woody Allen, like the rest of us, can reason as follows. Marshall McLuhan himself is the world's most noted living expert on popular media and culture. Or at least he was at the time that that movie was made. Therefore, we should lend great credence to whatever it is that Marshall McLuhan says on that topic. 

Unfortunately, since what Marshall McLuhan says on that topic is directly opposed to what the Columbia University professor says on that topic, the conclusion of our first amplifier argument is a conclusion that gets overridden by the second amplifier argument. Okay? So you have two amplifier arguments that occur in that clip that I just showed. Both amplifier arguments are good arguments. 

They're not sound arguments. They're not deductively sound. But they're inductively strong. But as we saw in unit three of the course, an inductively strong argument can still have a false conclusion. This is a case where we have two inductively strong arguments. They can't both have a true conclusion. One of them must have a false conclusion. And it appears that our second amplifier argument overrides our first. So here's a case where we have two good amplifier arguments. 

But good amplifier arguments are pretty few and far between. More often in daily life, we find bad amplifier arguments. 

上节课中我们区分了三种 诉诸权威的谬误 今天我想 讲的是三种里面的第一种 即强化令(amplifier) 那么什么是夸大其辞呢？ 我们会给它下定义 然后看几个例子 首先我们来看看几个夸大的例子 事实上它们是有效的论证 然后我们将看几个无效的夸大论证的例子 好的 首先 这是它的定义 那么什么是夸大其辞呢？ 夸张论证一般以某人的观点为前提 并以我们应该 着重考虑这个人的观点 作为结论 不管这个人说什么 他们都有特殊授权 他们所说都是很具有权威性的 

好了 这就是amplifier 

我之前说有时amplifier是有效论证 我们来看几个 amplifier的例子 这两个都是有效论证 请看 以下视频 可笑的是 Marshall Mcluhan 你对Marshall McLuhan的作品一无所知 哦 是吗？ 真的吗? 我恰好在哥伦比亚大学教一门叫"电视 媒体与文化"的课 我觉得我对McLuhan的见解 是非常深刻的 是吗？ 好的 在视频中我们看到其中一人是 哥伦比亚大学的教授 他是这样说的 大意是这样 

我在哥伦比亚大学教媒体和流行文化 

因此 你应该相信我所说的 观点 这就是这个人想要论证的 也是为什么他要提到他在哥伦比亚大学教媒体与流行文化这个课的原因 即为了让他的观点更可信 好的 如果某人是 哥伦比亚大学某课的教授 这确实让他在该话题上的观点更 可信一些 不过尽管这可能是个有效的amplifier论证 也不能说明它的结论就是对的 为了说明这并不能说明证明它的结论 是对的 至少不是令人信服的 我们需要看看 这段视频剩下的部分 同时也看看片中另一个 强化令论证 就在这里就在这里 因为McCluhan先生刚好在这 请借一步说话 告诉他吧 我听到你刚才说的话了 你根本就不了解我的作品 我整个理论都是错的 我真奇怪你是怎么当上教授的 人生就是这样 好的 这里发生了什么呢？ Marshell Mcluhan本人出现了 现在 伍迪埃伦 像我们其他人一样 可以这样说 Marshall McLuhan是目前世界上最有名望的 流行媒体与文化专家 至少在他制作这个电影的时候是的 因此我们要更倾向于相信 Marshall McLuhan所说的观点 

不幸的是 Marshall McLuhan的观点与这位 与这位哥伦比亚 大学教授的完全相反 我们 就被第二个 强化令论证推翻了 明白? 在我刚刚放的这段视频中出现了两个amplifier论证 两个都是有效的论证 

它们都不是可靠的论证 它们在逻辑推理上是不完备的 不过它们从非形式逻辑的角度来看还是很有力的论证 不过正如我们在本课第三单元所见 一个归纳上有力的论证仍然可能推出错误的结论 这就是两个有力的非形式逻辑论证的例子 它们的结论不可能同时为真 其中一个一定为假 而我们第二个强化令论证优先于第一个 这个例子中 我们有两个有效的强化令论证 

不过好的强化令论证非常少 在我们日常生活中 无效的强化令论证 更常见 

### Supporters

Today we're going to talk about another kind of appeal to authority, that we call a supporter. We're going to define what supporters are. Give a couple of examples of good supporter arguments, and then talk about some bad supporter arguments. Some supporter fallacies. So first, what are supporters? Well supporters are arguments that begin with premise about a particular person who's making a point. And they end with the conclusion to the effect that the person's reasons for their point are especially compelling especially good reasons. 

Might be the reasons are likely to be true or maybe their especially likely to support the conclusion but for, in whatever way they, they're especially good reasons. Okay now sometimes supporter arguments are good arguments let me give a couple of examples. 

So suppose I argue as follows. Premise one. Warren Buffett has argued that confidence in the dollar will rise, and therefore the price of gold will soon fall. 

Premise two. When Warren Buffett speaks, investors listen and believe. Therefore conclusion, confidence in the dollar will probably rise. Right? So the reason Warren Buffett gave in support of his conclusion that the price of gold will fall, namely that confidence in the dollar will rise, that reason is especially likely to be true. Why is it especially likely to be true? Well, I'm saying it's especially likely to be true because Warren Buffett said it was especially likely to be true. And when Warren Buffet says it, that makes it true because investors listen to what he says and they believe in him. And if investors all believe that other people are going to be confident in the dollar, then investors will all be confident in the dollar. 

Okay, so there's an example of a supporter argument. I start off with premises particular person. In this case, Warren Buffet. I start off with the premise to the effect that he's listened to by investors. Investors believe what he says. 

And I end up with a conclusion that the reason Warren Buffet gives in support of his conclusion, that the price of gold will fall, that that reason is an especially good reason. In this case it's especially likely to be true. That confidence in the dollar will rise. 

So there's an example of a supporter argument. That's a good argument. Here's another example. 

Premise one. Isaac Mizrahi says that, given how constricted pants have become in recent fashion, many people will now want to bring back bell-bottom pants. Premise two. Isaac Mizrahi is one of the trend setters in the fashion industry. That's what I gather from Googling things on the internet. But maybe one of you knows better. 

conclusion, it's true that many people will experience today's pants as constricting, and come to see bell-bottom pants as trendy. 

Okay. Now that's a supporter argument it starts off by stating a premise about Issac Mizrahi and the central place that he occupies in today's fashion street. And it ends up with a conclusion to the effect that. The reason Isaac Mizrahi gives for his conclusion that bell bottom pants are soon coming back, the reason that he gives is a reason that's especially likely to be true. Why is it especially likely to be true that people are going to experience today's pants as constricting? Well, it's especially likely to be true because Isaac Mizrahi said it was true. And if Isaac Mizrahi says that people are going to experience pants as constricting, then that's going to make it more likely to be true. Because, people who follow fashion feel about clothes roughly the way Isaac Mizrahi says they should feel about clothes. And so, if Isaac Mizrahi says that they're going to experience today's pants as constricting, then very likely, they will experience today's pants as constricting. And so they will demand a return of bell-bottom pants. 

Okay, so there's another supporter argument. And once again, I think this supporter argument is a good argument. It's not a deductively sound argument, but it's a good argument. 

Okay. So there are some examples of good supporter arguments. It's a lot easier to find examples of bad supporter arguments, of supporter fallacies. And we can see some of those right now. 

今天我们要讲另一种 诉诸权威的谬误 即支持者论证 我们将定义什么是支持者论证 然后看几个好的支持令例子 之后再来讨论几个无效的支持者论证 即支持者论证谬误 首先 什么是支持者论证呢 支持者论证通常以某人的 观点为前提 然后得出结论正是 所陈述的内容 因为他们的观点 更可信或者有更充分的原因 

这个原因属实也或许它们能很好地 支持结论 不管 是哪一种 他们都有很充分的理由 好的 有时支持令是好的论证 我举几个例子 

假设 我这样说 前提1 沃伦·巴菲特提出观点 美元信心将走强 因此金价短期内将走低 

前提2 投资者们倾听并且相信巴菲特的言论 所以结论是 美元信心将可能上涨 对吧? 巴菲特之所以支持他所得结论 即 金价将下挫 是因为美元信心 将上涨 而这个外因很可能成为事实 为什么呢？ 我这样说是因为 巴菲特说这很有可能发生 并且当巴菲特这样说时它就会成真 因为 投资者们都会听从并相信他的观点 如果投资者们都相信其他人将对美元更有信心 那么投资者们也将会对美元有信心 

好的 这就是支持令的例子 我以一个特定的人为前提 本例中 是巴菲特 例子中的前提是投资者们听从他的意见 投资者们相信他所说的话 

然后我得出结论说 巴菲特所给出的 支持金价将下挫这个结论的理由 是非常好的理由 这个例子中 它非常有可能是真的 即美元信心上涨 

这就是支持令的例子 是个有效的论证 来看另一个例子下面再举另一个例子 

前提之一 艾萨克·麦兹拉西(纽约最著名的设计师之一) 说 裤装在当前的时尚界设计得越来越紧 很多人希望重归喇叭裤潮流 前提2 艾萨克·麦兹拉西是时尚界潮流引领者之一 这是我从互联网上用谷歌搜到的信息 不过说不定你们对此更了解 

结论 一些人确实将感到现在的裤装 太紧 并且觉得喇叭裤将是潮流所趋 

好 这是个支持令 它的前提是关于 艾萨克·麦兹拉西以及他在当今时尚界的重要地位的 最后的结论是 艾萨克·麦兹拉西 得出结论说喇叭裤不久将重入潮流的原因 极有可能是真的 为什么人们将觉得现在的裤装设计太紧 这个前提极有可能是真的呢？ 因为艾萨克·麦兹拉西说这是事实所以才让它很有可能发生 并且如果艾萨克·麦兹拉西说人们将觉得裤装 太紧 那么这将会使这件事更有可能发生 因为跟随时尚潮流的人们对服装的感觉基本 是依据艾萨克·麦兹拉西所说的来的 所以 如果艾萨克·麦兹拉西说他们将觉得现在的 裤装过紧 那么很有可能 人们就会觉得现在的裤装过紧 那么他们就会希望 喇叭裤重归潮流 

好的 这就是第二个支持令 再次重申 我认为这个支持者论证也是一个有效的论证 虽然它从推理角度来看不是那么无懈可击 不过这是一个好的论证 

好 以上是一些有效的支持者论证的例子 找无效的支持者论证的例子 就容易多了 现在我们可以看一些这样的例子 

### Affirmers

In the last couple of lectures, we've talked about a couple different kinds of appeals to authority argument, affirmers and supporters. Today, we're going to wrap up our discussion of appeals to authority by talking about the third kind of appeal to authority argument, affirmers. So what's an affirmer? Once again, let me give a definition, give some examples of affirmers that are at least arguably good arguments, and finally we'll look at some examples of affirmers that are not good arguments, that are fallacies. Okay, so first, what's an affirmer? An affirmer is an argument that begins with a premise about a particular person who's making a point. So something about that person, and the argument ends with the conclusion that affirms that person's point, that endorses the conclusion that the person is drawing. So an affirmer doesn't say anything about the person's entitlement or authority on the issue. The affirmer doesn't say anything about the strength or quality of the person's reasons in support of their point. The affirmer just says well, they said it roughly so whatever conclusion they drew is true. 

That's the basic form of an affirmer. Okay, let's start with a couple of examples of affirmers that are, as I said at least arguably good arguments. Okay, the first example is very similar to an example that we saw last time, with supporters. There is a difference though. 

So, here's an affirmer version of the argument about Warren Buffett that we considered in the last class. Premise one. Warren Buffett has argued that confidence in the dollar will rise, and that therefore, the price of gold will soon fall. Premise two, when Warren Buffett speaks, investors listen and believe. Okay, now, those two premises are the same as the two premises of the supporter argument about Warren Buffett that we considered last time. But here the conclusion is different. Here the conclusion is, therefore the price of gold will soon fall. So here the conclusion is not that Warren Buffett's reasons for his claim are good. It's not that in fact confidence in the dollar will rise or that the rise in the confidence of the dollar is supportive of drop in the price of gold. The conclusion is simply that Warren Buffett's conclusion that the price of gold will soon fall. That conclusion is true. 

Okay. So the difference between this, affirmer argument, and that supporter argument might not seem very significant. This is an example of an argument that could be spun both as an affirmer and as a supporter. But sometimes, the difference between an affirmer and a supporter does matter, as in this next example. 

Suppose you argue as follows. The pope argues that masturbation is cardinal misuse of one's body, and that therefore, it's a sin. 

Conclusion, therefore masturbation is a sin. 

Now, there's some people, I think over a billion of them, who believe in the infallibility of the Pope. 

And if you're one of those people, then you will think that this is a good argument. I am not taking a view on whether or not its a good argument at least not for the purposes of this class but my point is that if you accept papal infallibility then your going to think that this is a good argument. But notice your going to think that this is a good argument even if you have no understanding what so ever of what the Pope means when he speaks of carnal misuse of one's body, even if that phrase is completely opaque to you, so you have no understanding at all of the Pope's reasons in support of his conclusion that masturbation is a sin. Still, you recognize the Pope has given some argument, to you the argument sounds like this. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Masturbation is a sin. That's what the argument sounds like to you. But since you believe in the infallibility of the Pope, you think that whatever there is to say about the reasons that the Pope gave, the conclusion must be true. It must be true that masturbation is a sin since after all the Pope said it and he argued for it. 

This is an example of an affirmer argument that is quite different from an analogous supporter argument, where you conclude from the fact that the Pope gave a certain argument that the reasons that he gave in the course of that argument must be good. Right here your not drawing any conclusion about the pope's reasons because you don't even understand the pope's reasons you don't know what carnal misuse of one's body is. Right? The only conclusion your drawing is that the pope's conclusion is true. 

And again for those of you who believe in papal infallibility this will look like a good argument. Right? If the pope is infallible and he argues that masturbation is a sin, than it must be a sin. 

Okay, so these are examples of affirmer arguments that are at least arguably, good arguments. Now we can look at some examples of affirmer arguments that are not so good. 

在过去的几讲中 我们已经谈到了 几个不同种类的服从权威 权威论点如证实者和支持者 今天 我们要总结我们对诉诸权威的讨论 我们要讲第三种诉诸权威论证 肯定令 那么什么是证实者？ 再次 让我给出肯定令的定义 和一些例子 至少算得上不错的论点 我们来看看一些肯定令的例子 它们缺少必要的理由 是谬论 好吧 首先 什么是一个肯定令？ 证实者是以 一个特定的人提出一个观点作为前提 以及关于这个人的一些事 并以证实和认可此人提出的观点 此人提出的观点作为结论的论证过程 所以证实者 并不在论题中提及此人的头衔或权威地位 肯定令也不提及此人支撑其观点的 理由的力度和质量 肯定令只是大致说 大致如此 他们得出的结论是正确的 

这是证实者的基本形式 好吧，让我们以一些肯定令的例子开始 这些例子 正如我所说的 至少可以说是有很好的理由 好了 第一个例子非常相似于 我们上次见过的支持者的例子 虽然是有区别的 

所以 本例是关于我们上节课讲过的 我们上次课考虑过的沃伦·巴菲特 前提之一 沃伦·巴菲特提出观点 美元信心将走强 上升 因此 黄金价格将很快回落 前提二 投资者倾听和相信沃伦·巴菲特的话 现在 这两个前提和我们上次考虑过的 沃伦·巴菲特的支持者论证的前提一模一样 但这里的结论是不同的 这里的结论是 因此 黄金价格将很快回落 所以 这里的结论不是沃伦·巴菲特的主张的理由足够好 这并不是说 事实上 对美元的信心上升 将会导致黄金价格的下降 结论仅仅是沃伦·巴菲特 关于黄金价格将很快下降的结论 这一结论是真实的 

好 所以证实者论证和支持者论证之间的 差异可能并不十分显着 这是一个论证既可以作为肯定令 又可以作为支持者的例子 但有时 证实者与支持者之间的差异 仍十分显著 下一个例子将体现这点 

假设你的论证如下 教皇认为自慰是对一个人身体的 严重的误用 因此 它是一种罪过 

结论 因此自慰 是一种罪过 

现在 有一些人 我觉得他们超过10亿 仍相信教皇不会犯错 

而如果你是那些人之一 那么 你会认为这是一个有理有据的论证 我不考虑论证的好坏 至少这不是本课的目的 但我的观点是 如果你 认为教皇不会犯错 那么你会认为论证有理有据 但是请注意 你会认为论证是好的 即使你 不理解当教皇说道对身体严重的误用他的意思 即使这句话对于你晦涩难懂 所以你无法理解教皇支持他结论的理由 该结论是自慰是一种罪过 不过 你意识到教皇做了个论证 对于你 论证听起来是这样的 嗡…嗡…嗡…嗡…嗡…嗡… 自慰是一种罪过 这就是你听到的论证 不过 既然你相信教皇不会犯错 你认为 无论教皇给出的原因是什么 得出的结论必须是真实的 自慰是一种罪过必须是真实的 因为毕竟教皇这么说也论证过 

这是一个证实者论证的例子 区别于类似的支持者论证 你的结论是从 教皇给出了具体的论证 且论证过程中 教皇给出的理由一定成立得来 这里关于教皇的理由你没得出任何结论 因为你甚至不明白教皇的理由 不明白何为对于身体的肉体的误用 对吧? 你能下的唯一结论是教皇的结论是真实的 

再次 对那些相信教皇不会犯错的人 这看起来像一个很好的论证 对吧? 如果教皇是万无一失的 他认为 自慰是一种罪恶 因此它必须是一种罪过 

好了 这些证实者论证的例子 至少可以说是论证合理的 现在我们可以看看一些不太好的肯定令例子 

### Appeals to Popular Opinion

Over the last few lectures we've been talking about fallacies of relevance including ad hominem arguments and appeals to authority. Today I want to talk about a kind of argument that's similar to an appeal to authority but not exactly the same. It's an appeal to popular opinion. Okay so what's an appeal to popular opinion? 

Here, let me give a definition, and then some examples. An appeal to popular opinion is an argument, that begins with premises, about the popularity of a particular claim, and ends with a conclusion, endorsing that claim. Roughly, an appeal to popular opinion is an argument of the form, well everyone believes it so it must be true. 

Now, some arguments of that form are actually good arguments. Let me give you some examples. 

So here's an argument premise. Many people think, at least in my experience as a teacher, I found many people think that the verb to emulate is a synonym of the verb to imitate. 

Therefore, conclusion, at least one of the meanings of the verb to emulate is the same as the meaning of the verb to imitate. 

Now that's an appeal to popular opinion. It starts out saying what it is that a lot people think and then it draws a conclusion, that what a lot of people think is true. 

But here, I think this is actually a pretty good argument. And the reason it's a good argument is because what the verb to emulate means depends at least in part on what the users of that verb take it to mean. What they use it to mean. And if people are using the verb to emulate to mean imitate, then at least one of the meanings of the verb to emulate becomes imitate. 

So popular opinion, in this example, popular opinion makes it true that the verb to emulate has at least one of the meanings that it has. 

Okay here's another example in a different domain, but a similar sort of phenomenon where you have a good argument that's an appeal to popular opinion. 

So premise, more and more merchants regard the local currency as losing value. Therefore, conclusion, the local currency is losing value. 

Once again this is a pretty good argument. And it's a good argument because if more and more merchants regard the local currency as losing value, then they're not going to be as willing to trade their goods and services for the local currency. They will demand more of the local currency in exchange for their goods and services. Or maybe they simply won't be willing to accept the local currency at all in exchange for their goods and services. And if that's true, then the local currency will lose value, because each unit of the local currency will have less purchasing power. And so the local currency will lose value. Once again, here's a case where popular opinion makes true what it is that the people believe. 

So this is a good argument that's an example of an appeal to popular opinion. Not all appeals to popular opinion though are good arguments. Some of them are bad arguments, some of them are fallacies, and let's take a look at some of those right now. 

在过去几讲中 我们一直在谈论相关性谬论 包括人身攻击的论证 和服从权威 今天 我想谈谈类似于服从权威的论证 但不完全一样 它服从的是公众意见 

好吧 那么什么是服从公众意见？ 在这里 让我给一个定义 然后一些例子 服从公众意见是以 说到某断言的普及程度的前提为开始 以认可该断言的结论结束的论证 粗略地说 服从公众意见的论证格式是 每个人都相信它 所以它必须是真实的 

现在 这种形式的一些论证实际上是很好的 让我给你一些例子 这里有一个论证 前提是 很多人认为 至少以我的经验 作为一名教师 我发现许多 人们认为动词 模拟(emulate)是动词 模仿(imitate)的同义词 

因此 结论 模拟(emulate)这个动词 与动词模仿(imitate)的含义相同 

这就是服从公众意见 它开始说有 很多人都那么认为 接着得出结论 很多人都那么认为的是真实的 

但在这里 我觉得这其实是一个相当不错的 论证 这是一个很好的论证的理由是因为 动词模拟(emulate)的含义 至少部分地取决于 该动词的使用者所采取的它的意思 他们用它来表示什么 如果人们使用模拟(emulate)去表达模仿(imitate)的意思 那么至少动词模拟(emulate)有一个含义就变成了 模仿(imitate) 因此 在本例中 公众意见 让这件事 模拟(emulate)一词具备了至少一个含义 模仿 这件事成立 好的 这里是另一个例子 在不同的领域中 均有类似的现象 在那里你有 一个很好的诉诸群众论证 

所以 前提 越来越多的商家认为本地货币正在贬值 因此 综上所述 本地货币正在贬值 

再次 这是一个相当不错的论证 不错的理由是因为如果越来越多的商家都认为 本地货币正在贬值 那么他们就不再 愿意牺牲自己的商品和服务 去换取本地货币 他们会要求更多的本地货币 来换取他们的商品和服务 或者他们 根本不会愿意接受本地货币 来交换自己的商品和服务 如果这是真的 那么本地货币将会贬值 因为每单位的本地货币购买力降低 因此 本地货币 将贬值 再次 这一例子是 公众意见使得人们 相信的东西成真 好了 所以这是一个很好的论证 诉诸群众的一个例子 并不是所有的诉诸群众论证都是好论证 一些 论证很糟糕 一些是谬论 现在让我们来看看其中的一些 

# Fallacies of Vacuity and Circularity

CONTENT: Now we will describe another common set of fallacies: fallacies that occur when an argument makes no progress from its premises to its conclusion. Sometimes, arguments make no progress because the conclusion is already contained in the premises. Sometimes, arguments make no progress because the conclusion is presupposed by the premises. And sometimes, arguments make no progress because the premises don’t make any claim at all, even if they might sound like they do. When you know how to identify such fallacies, you will find that they are more common than you think! LEARNING OUTCOMES: By the end of this section you will be able to: identify various kinds of circularity or vacuity where they occur OPTIONAL READING: If you want more examples or more detailed discussions of these topics, we recommend Understanding Arguments,Ninth Edition, Chapter 16.

## Vacuity

### Fallacies of Vacuity

We've devoted this week so far to talking about fallacies or relevance but today we're going to talk about fallacies of vacuity. Let me begin by defining what a fallacy of vacuity is. 

A fallacy of vacuity is a fallacy that results. When, roughly speaking, an argument starts by assuming what it's supposed to establish. You could think of it this way. A fallacy of vacuity is an argument that doesn't go anywhere. 

its starting points presuppose what it is that the argument is supposed to prove. 

Okay, so there are different kinds of fallacies of vacuity. 

And in this lecture and the next we are going to be talking about three different kinds of fallacies of vacuity. The first is something called circularity. A circular argument. A fallacy of circularity occurs when, an argument's conclusion is contained among its premises. Eh, you write out the premises of the argument and one of the premises just is the conclusion, that's a circular argument. And that fallacy is called circularity. 

another broader kind of fallacy of vacuity when I say broader kind of fallacy of vacuity. I mean this kind of fallacy of vacuity includes circularity as a sub species is what's called begging the question. 

Begging the question is when an argument has the following feature. 

In order to be reasonable in believing the premises of that argument, you already have to have a good reason for believing the conclusion. 

So, unless you already have a good reason for believing the conclusion independently of the premises. The argument can't go anywhere because you won't have a good reason for believing the premises. And so, if you don't have a good reason for believing the premises, then the argument can't give you a good reason for believing the conclusion. So roughly, an argument begs the question when you need to have a good reason for believing the conclusion already in order for you to have an reason to believe the premises of the argument. That's begging the question, right? That includes circularity. Because notice, in a circular argument, you have to have a good reason for believing the conclusion in order to have a good reason for believing the premises. Because the conclusion is one of the premises. 

But begging the question can happen even without circularity, and we'll talk about examples of that next time. The last kind of fallacy of vacuity that I wanted to describe is something called self-sealing. Now a self-sealer can be either a proposition or an argument. But roughly, a self-sealer is when a proposition or an argument is irrefutable by any possible consideration, no matter what. And so it doesn't rule out anything. So, if I make some claim to the effect that at a certain point in time, you will then be doing exactly what you will be doing. 

You might think, well yeah, so what does that tell me? 

What possible situations are ruled out by that statement? The answer is none. And so that statement is empty, it's vacuious. It's a self-sealer in the sense that there's no possible situation that it rules out. And so there's no possible consideration or evidence that could be brought forth against it. 

A self-sealing argument is one that commits a fallacy of acuity. Because it does assume what it's intended to establish. Unfortunately, in a self-sealing argument. What it's intended to establish is nothing of any significance. It's nothing that rules out any possibility. And so, it does tend to assume what it's supposed to establish. 

So, those are three kinds of vacuity that I wanted to distinguish. In the next lecture, we'll talk a bit more about circularity and begging the question. And in the lecture after that, we'll talk a bit more about self sealing. See you next time. 

这一周我们一直在讨论相关性谬误 但是今天我们将讨论空洞谬误 让我先来定义什么是空洞谬误 

空洞谬误是一种 粗略说来 由于一个论证一开始的假设 就是基于它要论述的东西 而产生的谬误 你可以这么想 空洞谬误是一种什么 都没说的论证 

它的出发点是基于这个论证想要证明的点 

好吧 所以有不同类型的空洞谬误 

在本次讲课和下一次讲课中 我们将讨论三种不同类型的空洞谬误 第一种是循环论证 一个循环的论证 循环论证 即是当一个论证的结论 包含于它的假设 呃 如果你写下论证的前提 而其中一个前提就是结论的话 就是循环论证 而这种谬误就成为循环论证 

另一种更广义的空洞谬误 注意我说更广义 是在说这种空白谬误 能把循环论证当做一个子集包含 这个谬误称为乞题 

乞题就是当论证有下述特征时的情况 

为了能理性地相信论证中的前提 你已经必须要充分地相信结论了 

所以 除非你 已经能无视前提地去充分相信结论了 论证其实什么也没说 因为你没有 一个充足的理由去相信前提 而且 如果你没有充足的理由相信前提 那么论证就不能给你充足的理由去接受结论 所以大致来说 一个论证在乞题就是说 你需要一个充足的理由去相信结论 以使你能有充分的理由相信论证的前提 那就是乞题 对吧 这个包括了循环论证 因为注意到 在循环论证中 你必须要有充足的理由 去相信结论才能有相信前提的理由 因为结论是前提之一 

但是乞题甚至可以 不包括循环论证 我们将在下节课 讨论例子 最后一种空洞谬误 我想跟大家介绍的 是自我封闭 自我封闭可以是一个命题或者一个论证 但是大致上 自我封闭是一种 无法被任何可能的情形反驳的情况 所以它并没有排除任何事 所以 如果我在某个时间点 断言了一些事 你的生活依旧 不会有任何改变 

你也许会想 好吧 那又有怎么样 

那个陈述排除了哪些情况呢 什么都没哟 所以这个论证是空的 空洞的 这是地球 自我封闭 因为没有任何可能的情形被它排除 所以没有可能的情形或者证据 可以拿得出来反对它 

一个自我封闭论证是一个产生空洞谬误的论证 因为它假设了它要证明的东西 不幸的是 在自我封闭的论证中 它想要证明的事没有任何意义 它并没有 排除任何可能性 而且 它假设了它要证明的东西 

所以 这就是我想加以区别的三种空洞 在下一节课中 我们将讨论 更多关于循环论证和乞题的事 而下下节课 我们会讨论更多的自我封闭 我们下次见。 

### Circularity and Begging the Question

Now that we've introduced the topic of fallacies of acuity, today we're going to talk about circularity and begging the question. 

So what are these things? What is circularity and what is begging the question? 

Circularity is a fallacy that results when an argument's premises contain its conclusion, when the conclusion is right there among the premises. 

Now, this is a really egregious fallacy, not one that people are likely to make very often, because it's so easy to notice. But let me give you an example, just so you can see what I'm talking about. So consider this simple example of circularity. 

Premise one, this argument, this very argument, has a premise. Premise two, this very argument has a conclusion. 

Therefore, conclusion, this argument has a conclusion. 

Now notice, the conclusion of that argument is the same proposition as premise two of that argument. In other words, the conclusion is right in the premises. 

That's a circular argument. That's an example of a fallacy of circularity. 

That's pretty hard to miss, and that's not the kind of fallacy that most people often make. 

But circularity is one very egregious example of a more general kind of fallacy that lots of people make, and that's called begging the question. So what's begging the question? 

Well, begging the question is a kind of fallacy that results when you can't have any reason for accepting the premises of the argument unless you already have some independent reason for believing the conclusion. Right, so in a certain sense the argument assumes what it sets out to prove, because unless you already have a good reason for believing the conclusion to be true, you can't have a good reason for believing the premises to be true. And without having a good reason for believing the premises to be true, the argument can't give you any insight. It can't teach you anything. No argument can teach you something unless you have a good reason for believing the premises of that argument to be true. 

So that's the fallacy of begging the question. 

Now, what's an example of that? 

These examples can be a little more subtle. 

Right, because not all forms of begging the question are circularity. Let me give an example of begging the question that doesn't involve circularity. 

So consider this argument. Again, it's a simple argument. The Pope says that he is infallible. 

Premise two, whatever the Pope says is always right. 

Therefore, conclusion, the Pope is infallible. 

Now notice that argument is obviously valid, right. If the Pope says that he's infallible and whatever he says is right, then he must be right to say that he's infallible. In fact, that's how the doctrine of papal infallibility was first established was by papal decree. I'll let you look that up. 

Anyhow, if the premises of the argument are true, the conclusion has to be true. So the argument is valid, but even though the argument is valid, in fact, even if the argument is sound, the argument is still a fallacy. And the reason it's a fallacy is that we can't have any good reason for believing premise two of the argument, unless we already have some reason, independently of the argument, for believing the conclusion. Right, unless we already know that the pope is infallible, why should we believe that whatever the pope says is always right? Well, maybe there is some other reason, but unless that additional reason is supplied In the argument, this argument begs the question. It begs the question, because it relies on premises that we have no reason to believe unless we already have a good reason to believe the conclusion independently of the argument itself. So this argument is an example of begging the question, but notice it's not an example of circularity. The conclusion of the argument that the Pope is infallible, that conclusion is not in the premises. It's not one of the premises. Right, there are two premises in the argument, and neither of those premises says precisely that the Pope is infallible. 

So this argument is an example of begging the question, but it's an example of begging the question that doesn't involve circularity. And that sort of fallacy is much harder to notice, much easier to make, and much more common in everyday life. You can see some examples right now. 

现在 既然我们已经开始介绍了空洞谬误 今天我们将讨论循环论证和乞题 

那么 这些名词是什么意思呢 什么是循环论证 什么是乞题呢 

循环论证是一种在论证的前提中 包含了结论的谬误 即结论在前提之中 这是一个很恶劣的谬误 不是那种人们经常会犯的谬误 因为这样太容易发现了 让我给你举一个例子吧 这样你就明白了 想想看这个简单的循环论证的例子 

前提一 这个论证 有一个前提 前提二 这个论证有一个结论 

所以 结论是 这个论证有一个结论 

现在 注意 这个论证的结论 和前提二的命题是一样的 换句话说 结论就在前提当中 

这就是循环论证 这就是一个循环论证的谬误的例子 

这很难不注意到 这也不是人们会常常犯的谬误 但是循环论证是一个非常恶劣的 人们常犯的更普遍的谬误的例子 而那就叫做乞题 那么什么是乞题呢 

乞题就是一种 除非你有独立的原因 去接受结论 不然你无法接受 论证的前提时 产生的谬误 对吧 那么 在某种意义上 论证假设了它应该证明的事情 因为除非你已经有充足的理由相信结论 不然你无法有充足的理由相信前提 但是没有充足理由相信前提的话 论证并不能告诉你任何事 它无法教你任何事情 好吧 除非你有充足的理由 相信一个论证的前提是真的 不然没有论证可以教你任何东西 

那么 这就是乞题的谬误 

现在 有什么例子么 好吧 这些例子有一点微妙 

好的 因为不是所有的乞题都是循环论证 让我给你一个乞题的但不是循环论证的例子 

那么考虑这个论证 这还是一个简单的论证 教皇说他是不可能错的 

前提二 教皇说的都是对的 

所以 结论是 教皇是不可能错的 

现在注意 这个论证明显是有效的 好吧 如果教皇说他是不会错的 而他说的 又都是对的 那么他必须是不会错的 事实上 这就是教宗的教典上 教皇无误论的原型 写在教令上的 你们可以去查查看 

无论如何 如果论证的前提是对的 结论必须是对的 所以论证是有效的 但是即使它是有效的 事实上 就算论证是完备的 这个论证仍然是一个谬误 它之所是谬误的原因 就是我们 无法充分地相信论证的两个前提 除非我们已经能独立于论证本身地 论证本身地相信结论 对吧 除非我们已经知道教皇是不会错的 为什么我们要相信教皇说的都是对的呢 

好吧 也许有其他的原因 但是除非这个原因 出现在了论证当中 不然这个论证还是乞题 它之所以乞题 因为它依赖于我们没有理由相信的前提 除非我们有充足的理由 独立于论证本身的去相信结论 所以这个论证是一个乞题的例子 但是注意到这不是一个 循环论证 论证的结论 即 教皇不会错 这个结论并不在前提中 它不是前提之一 好吧 这个论证有两个前提 而且它们都没说教皇是不会错的 

所以这个论证是乞题 但是是一个并非循环论证的乞题 而这种谬误会难以发现得多 容易犯得多 在日常生活中常见得多 你现在可以看到一些例子 

### Self-Sealers

Today, we're going to conclude our discussion of fallacies of acuity by talking about self-sealers. So what's a self-sealer? Let me start by giving a definition and then giving some examples. So first, a self-sealer is a proposition or an argument that's irrefutable. It can't be refuted. Because, it doesn't claim anything, it doesn't rule out any conceivable situation. 

So, in that sense it doesn't place any constraint on how the world has to be, any possible way that the world is would conform to the proposition. 

So, what are some examples of that? 

Well, suppose someone says, and you might have heard philosophers who say this, suppose someone says, all human action is selfish. Now, at first, this seems like a bold conjecture. 

a very substantial thesis that could be right or it could be wrong. 

There's an obvious objection to this thesis you say well look what about self sacrificing heroism. Occasionally people will lay down their lives, in the service of a cause that's larger than they are. Suppose you present this counter example to the proponent of this generalization, and they say, well, look even self-sacrificing heroism is itself, motivated by the desire to be a hero, so the person who is performing the self-sacrificing heroism is still really acting selfishly, because they're just trying to satisfy their own personal desire to be a hero. Some people want chocolate, and so they go out to get chocolate. Some people want to be a hero, so they go out looking to be a hero. 

Okay well, suppose we decide to investigate this further. We find people who are 

who tend to engage in self-sacrificing, heroic behavior. Maybe people who are lucky enough to have engaged in such behavior in the past and they're still alive, and so, we find such people, and we test them in various ways. We do brain scans of them. We give them various surveys. We do behavioral tests on them, trying to test whether or not they have the desire to be a hero. And all our tests come up empty-handed. We just don't find any evidence, no matter how many tests we perform. We don't find any evidence that this person, or these people, really do have the desire to be a hero. They just aren't thinking about being a hero. They just want to save the world, or save their fellow people, or save the environment, or whatever. Right? So, it's because of the larger cause that they're thinking about, that they engage in self-sacrificing, heroic behavior, and we have no evidence that they want to be a hero. Now suppose that we present all of this evidence to the proponent of the generalization in question. We say Look. We've tested these people. We've given them brain scans, we've done surveys with them, we've done all sorts of behavioral tests with them, and we can't find any evidence that they have some desire to be a hero, a desire that motivates their self-sacrificing heroic behavior. And suppose that we put this to the proponent of the generalization, they reply by saying, oh, look. 

even if their desire to be a hero isn't rendered apparent by the tests that you've performed, it must still be there. After all, how else could we explain their self-sacrificing heroic behavior? Okay, but now it's clear that the person is offering us a self-sealer. It's a position which they can defend, no matter what evidence they're presented with. Right. So no matter what evidence comes up, no matter what consideration come up they can stick to their guns. They can continue to propound their view that all human action is selfish. 

But now it's pretty clear that the view they're propounding the propostion they're putting forth 

Doesn't claim anything. It doesn't rule out any possible way that the world could be. Because as we come upon various ways that the world is that seem to tell against their generalization, what they do is they make their generalization less and less specific, so that even if the selfishness of which they speak isn't made manifest in any way at all. It's going to be made manifest in the human action itself, right? So as long as there's human action there's gotta be selfishness they say because what other way could you explain the human action. 

Okay, that's a self sealer. It's a self sealer because they're simply insisting on the position in the face of any evidence that comes up. 

Alright. Now, that's a self-sealing proposition. What's a self-sealing argument? Well, typically, self-sealing arguments are arguments that contain among their premises self-sealing propositions, they're arguments that depend on self-sealing propositions. 

But there might be an example of a self-sealing argument that isn't like that. I say might, I don't say there is an example, I say there might be an example. 

Let me offer it to you now and see what you all think. Here's the example. 

Premise one. Not every argument has a conclusion. 

See. 

Now, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, wait a second, didn't we define argument way back in one of those early weeks with a different teacher, didn't we define argument as something that had one or more premises and a conclusion? Wasn't that just built in to the very definition of argument? 

Well, look. Sometimes things can be built in to the very definition of something. But still, you can come upon considerations or evidence that lead you to revise that definition. All right, there're all sorts of institutions in human life, that are defined in various ways, and then as the world changes, we decide we want to revise that definition and there could be good reasons for doing so. So, originally we defined an argument as some premises and conclusion but, maybe we should revise that definition. Why does an argument need to have a conclusion? Couldn't an argument just have a premise and that's it? 

Well, I'll let you debate that in the forums. But I just wanted to point out that if this really is an argument, if this premise really does constitute an argument, then the premise is true that not every argument has a conclusion. 

But unless you can think of some way of refuting, the proposition that not every argument has a conclusion, then this particular argument, consisting of the premise that not ever argument has a conclusion, this particular argument is a self-sealer, because there's no evidence that you could present. To show that the argument itself is unsound or unsuccessful. So, that's an example of an argument that's a self-sealer, which, if it's an argument that's a self-sealer, is not the same as any particular proposition that's a self sealer, because the premise, not every argument has a conclusion. That premise is a proposition. And that proposition is not a self-sealer. But if that premise is an argument, the argument may be a self-sealer. Okay. All right. So that concludes our week on fallacies of relevance and vacuity. I'll see you next week, when we'll talk about refutation. See you then. 

今天 我们将总结一下我们对于 空白性谬误的讨论 通过讲解自我封闭 所以什么是自我封闭呢 让我们先给出定义然后给一些例子 首先 自我封闭是一种无法被反驳的命题或者论证 它不可能被反驳 因为它没有断言任何事情 它并未排除任何可以想得到的情形 

那么 这意味着它并未对这个世界应该是怎样的设定任何限制 任何样子的世界都能符合这个命题 

那么有哪些例子呢 

好吧 假设某人说 你也许听过说这句话的 哲学家们的名字 假设某人说 人类所有的行为都是自私的 现在 首先 这看起来是一个大胆的假设 

一个非常实质性的理论 要么对要么错 

对这个理论有一个很明显的反驳 你可以说 那么自我牺牲的英雄主义呢 有些时候人们会牺牲自己的性命 为了服务于一些比他们本身更为庞大的原因 假设你向提出这个泛化的人说出了 这一个反例 他们会说 就算是 自我牺牲的英雄主义 也是被想成为英雄的欲望 所驱使的 所以那些做出自我牺牲英雄主义的人 实际上仍然是做出了自私的举动 因为他们只是为了 满足他们自己的想当英雄的欲望 有些人想吃巧克力 所以出门买巧克力 有些人想当英雄 所以他们出门寻找当英雄的机会 

好吧 假设我们想更进一步的研究这个理论 我们会找到一些 

有进行自我牺牲式英雄行为的倾向的人 也许有些人过去经历了这种行为而且很幸运的活到了现在 所以 我们找到这样的人 然后用不同的方法测试他们 我们使用脑部扫描 我们给他们调查问卷 我们对他们进行行为测试 以测试他们 是否有成为英雄的欲望 而我们所有的测试都会毫无斩获 我们就是找不到任何证据 无论我们做多少测试 我们找不到任何证据证明这个人 或者这些人 真的有成为英雄的欲望 他们只是没有在想着成为一个英雄 他们只是想拯救世界或者 拯救他们的同伴 或者拯救环境等等 对吧? 所以 因为那个更大的原因 他们在想着的那个原因 才使他们进行了自我牺牲的英雄行为 而我们没有证据证明他们想当英雄 现在假设我们把所有这些证据 摆在当初提出这个泛化问题的人面前 我们说 看看 我们测试了这些人 我们做了脑部扫描 各种调查 还有各种各样的 行为测试 而且我们找不到 任何证据说明他们有成为英雄的欲望 那种驱使他们做出自我牺牲的英雄行为的欲望 假设我们这么给出了证据 他们可以这么回答 看 

就算他们想当英雄的欲望没有明显的 被你们那些测试揭露出来 它一定存在的 不然的话 我们还能怎么解释他们的自我牺牲式英雄行为 好吧 但是很明显对方是在对我们使用自我封闭 这是一个他们可以无论面对 何种证据都能防得住的情形 对吧 那么无论出现了什么样的证据 无论出现了什么样的想法 他们都可以固执己见 他们可以继续吹捧他们那人类行为都是自私的观点 

但是现在已经很清楚了 他们吹捧的那种观点 他们推出的那个命题 

并没有断言任何事情 它没有排除世界是什么样子的任何可能 因为当我们提出各种各样与他们提出的泛化不同的 世界的样子时 他们都可以不断使他们的泛化 越来越不具体 以至于即使他们自己所说的自私 也不能以任何方式证明了 而将会被人类行为本身所证实 对吧 所以只要存在人类行为 就一定存在自私 他们说 不然的话你还能怎么解释人类行为 

好吧 这就是一个自我封闭 它是一个自我封闭的原因是他们只是单纯的坚持 自己的立场 无视任何出现的证据 

好 这是一个自我封闭的命题 什么是自我封闭的论证呢 好吧 一般来说 自我封闭的论证 是在它们的前提中包含了自我封闭的命题的论证 即是依存于自我封闭的命题的论证 

但也许有一个自我封闭的 论证的例子并不是这样的 我是说也许 不是一定 是说也许有一个例子 

让我给你们看看这个例子 看看你们怎么认为 这个例子是这样的 

前提一 并非每一个论证都有结论 

看 

现在我知道你在想什么 你在想 等一等 我们当初头几周和另外一个老师 学习的时候 不是定义论证为一种拥有 一个或者更多前提以及一个结论的东西吗 那不就恰恰是被论证的定义所包含吗 

好吧 看着 有些时候事物可以被它的准确定义 所包含 但是 你仍然可以提出想法和证据 来引导你修缮那个定义 好吧 人们生活中有各种各样的存在 是被以不同的方式定义的 而且随着 世界的变化 我们决定我们需要修缮某个定义 而且会有好的这么做的理由 所以一开始我们定义了论证为 一些前提和结论 但是也许我们应该修缮这个定义 为什么一个论证必须要有结论呢 难道论证不能只有一个前提而已吗 

好吧 我留给你们在论坛里面讨论 但是我只想指出 如果这真的是一个论证 如果这个前提 真的组成了论证的一部分 那么这个前提 是真的 即并非每个论证都有一个结论 

但是除非你能想出某种 反驳的方法 反驳这个命题即不是每一个论证 都有一个结论 那么这个特定的论证 由不是每个论证都有结论的前提组成的论证 这个特定的论证是自我封闭的 因为没有能拿得出来的证据 可以证明论证本身不是完备的 或者不成功的 所以这就是一个 自我封闭的论证的例子 而这个例子 如果是一个是自我封闭的论证 就不与 任何自我封闭的命题相同 因为这个前提 不是每个论证都有结论 这个前提是一个命题 而这个命题不是自我封闭的 但是如果这个前提时论证 那论证也许是一个自我封闭 好吧 好的 所以因此 我们结束了关于相关性谬误和空洞谬误的这一周 我们下一周再见 届时我们会讨论反驳 下节课再见 【教育无边界字幕组】沁鸩玮|FH|Sandrine
