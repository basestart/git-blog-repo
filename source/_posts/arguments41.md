# Welcome to the Course

Welcome to Think Again: How to Avoid Fallacies! This course is the fourth in a series of four courses jointly titled Think Again: How to Reason and Argue. We are excited that you are taking this course, and we hope that you will take all four courses in the series, because there is a great deal of important material to learn. In the series as a whole, you learn how to analyze and evaluate arguments and how to avoid common mistakes in reasoning. These important skills will be useful to you in deciding what to believe and what to do in all areas of your life. We encounter fallacies almost everywhere we look. Politicians, salespeople, and children commonly use fallacies in order to get us to think what they want us to think. Think Again: How to Avoid Fallacies will show how to identify and avoid many of the fallacies that people use to get us to think the way they want us to think. The first part of this course introduces the series and the course. It also clarifies some peculiarities you may find with this course. We encourage you to watch the "Introduction to the Course" video first as it will help you learn more from the materials that come later.

## Introduction

### Introduction to the Course

[BLANK AUDIO] Hi, I'm Walter Sinnott-Armstrong from Duke University. >> And I'm Ram Neta from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. >> Three years ago, Ram and I constructed a Coursera course called Think Again. 

It taught students how to analyze and evaluate arguments. >> It taught them how to tell the difference between good reasoning and bad reasoning. >> Over the last three years we've had a wonderful time teaching Think Again. And we really enjoyed interacting in the discussion forums with students from all over the world. >> We were extremely pleased with the reaction to our course. Over the past three years over 750,000 students enrolled in that course. >> But we realized that we could teach the course even more effectively if we made a few small changes. >> First, it wasn't easy to cover all the material that we wanted to cover, in the 12 weeks of our course. Each week contained hours of lecture, exercises, and quizzes, and doing all those hours of work every week for 12 weeks was a tall order. >> In the third week of each section of that old course, we asked you to learn new material. And then also take a quiz. But that's just too much. >> So for these reasons we decided that the best way for students to learn all of the material that we wanted to teach them was to divide up our original course into four much shorter courses. 

That way you can take one of the courses, take off a month or two, take another course, maybe skip a course. We hope you won't, but do it at your own pace in the way that fits your lifestyle best. 

And that way, you're most likely to end up learning all of the material that we want you to learn. Maybe not this year, but eventually. 

And the material really does fit together. So, even though we've split up the course into four separate courses, it's very worthwhile for you to take all the different courses if you possibly can. >> The lectures in the mini course that you're about to take now, 

were all part of our original 12 week course. 

And so frequently you're going to find that we make references in those lectures to other features of that original 12 week course. >> For example, very early on I say, that arguments have a form or a structure and that we'll study that form or structure, in future weeks in the course, and now that's in the second course, the course on deductive logic >> And I begin the course in deductive logic by saying, welcome to unit two of our course. Well, I was referring to unit two of our original 12 week course, but now, deductive logic is its own course. And when I talk about weeks four and five, I'm referring to weeks four and five of our original 12 week course. But now, they're weeks one and two of the deductive logic course. >> We hope this is not too confusing but the basic message is really simple. Just ignore all of those cross-references to other parts of courses or other courses. Just the same way that you ignore the wrinkles on an old road map. >> Hey! I like to use wrinkled road maps. >> Well, it's fine to use wrinkled road maps as long as you know the wrinkles aren't extra roads because then you're going to drive off onto them. >> So you're saying that the students can learn all the material that we want to teach them even if they ignore all of our references to the old 12 week course? >> Exactly. >> Sounds like a plan to me. >> We hope that you enjoy taking this mini course just as much as we enjoyed making it. >> And we hope that it encourages you to take the other courses in our Think Again sequence. >> And also encourage your friends and family to take this series of courses as well, because it's a lot more fun to take these courses together with other people so that you can talk to them about the arguments you'll be studying. 

Thank you for listening. 

### course logistics

Welcome to Think Again: How to Avoid Fallacies! This course is the fourth in a series of four courses titled Think Again: How to Reason and Argue. We are excited that you are taking this course, and we hope that you will take all four courses in the series, because there is a great deal of important material to learn.

In the series as a whole, you learn how to analyze and evaluate arguments and how to avoid common mistakes in reasoning. These important skills will be useful to you in deciding what to believe and what to do in all areas of your life.

The fourth course in the series focuses on fallacies. We encounter fallacies almost everywhere we look. Politicians, salespeople, and children commonly use fallacies in order to get us to think what they want us to think. Think Again: How to Avoid Fallacies will show how to identify and avoid many of the fallacies that people use to get us to think the way they want us to think.

This course will contain lectures, ungraded exercises, and one final quiz that will count towards the certificate, if you choose.

LECTURES: Each week will consist of a set of modules that will contain a series of short lectures along with practice quizzes. The topics are described in the syllabus on the course website and at the beginning of each week.

EXERCISES: Throughout the course you will find a series of exercises in the form of practice quizzes. The point of the exercises is only to make sure that you understand the material in the corresponding lecture. They are not intended to be difficult. If you miss too many of these exercises and if you do not understand the explanations of the answers that we provide, then it might be a good idea to listen again to the relevant lecture before proceeding to the next lecture. All of these exercises are ungraded and optional, but we hope that they will help you learn more. If you have trouble with the exercise, then you should post your questions on the discussion forums. If you do not have trouble, please go into the discussion forums and help your fellow students with their questions. The best way to learn is to teach. In the previous runs of this course, many students were extremely good at explaining these exercises to other students. We and our teaching assistants will also check the forums occasionally in order to provide additional assistance.

FINAL QUIZ: The final quiz at the end of the course will contain questions similar to the exercises. You may take the quiz as many times as you want in order to pass, with different questions each time. You will be able to retake the quiz three times every eight hours. We will provide explanations of all of the answers in each quiz so that you can check those explanations before trying the quiz again.

TEXTBOOK: We suggest that you obtain and read the recommended textbook: Understanding Arguments, Ninth Edition, Concise Version, by Walter Sinnott-Armstrong and Robert Fogelin. Chapters 13-17 are relevant to this fourth course in the series. This textbook is not required in order to do well in this course or the other courses in this series, but it will probably help you by providing more examples, exercises, and explanations. You can buy a paperback or electronic copy here, if you like:

Link to buy Understanding Arguments, Ninth Edition, Concise Version

WORKLOAD: For each weeks worth of material, you should expect to spend on average roughly 2 hours watching the lectures, another 2 hours doing the exercises, another hour per week reading the textbook (which is optional), and about 1 hour each time you take the final quiz. Some students spend more time, and some spend less. The amount of time you spend is entirely up to you. The more time you spend, the more you will learn.

FORUMS: The best way to learn about arguments is to practice constructing your own arguments and analyzing arguments given by other people, especially people with whom you disagree. We provide opportunities for such exchanges in the discussion forums, which are also places to find answers to your questions, new examples, and stimulating discussions of various issues with fellow students from around the world.

Special Discussion Forums can also be used to set up study groups, give feedback on course material, seek help with technical difficulties, and tell us and other students about yourself. Please be polite when using these forums. You will be able to vote up or down posts in these forums so that the most useful posts will rise to the top and be seen first.

EMAIL POLICY: Please do NOT email the professors. Unfortunately, it will not be possible for us respond. We wish we could, but there are simply too many students for us to be able to reply to individual emails. Thanks for understanding.

SPREAD THE WORD: You will get more out of this course if you share the adventure, so we suggest that you encourage your friends, relatives, neighbors, or colleagues to take the course with you.

We hope that you are looking forward to the course. We are.

Let’s get going!

# Fallacies of Unclarity

CONTENT: In this week's material we will describes two phenomena that are both common and useful in the languages that human beings speak, but both of which give rise to the potential for fallacious reasoning. A word or phrase is vague when its meaning is not precise, and it is ambiguous when it has more than one meaning. When we use vague or ambiguous phrases in our reasoning, it is very easy for us to make a number of different kinds of fallacies. This week will teach you what these different kinds of fallacies are, and give us some practice in spotting them, so you can make sure to avoid them in the future. LEARNING OUTCOMES : By the end of this week's material you will be able to: define what a fallacy is distinguish various kinds of fallacies understand the linguistic phenomena that give rise to fallacies identify various kinds of slippery slop fallacies where they occur identify various kinds of fallacies of equivocation where they occur OPTIONAL READING: If you want more examples or more detailed discussions of the fallacies that result from vaguness or ambiguity, we recommend Understanding Arguments, Ninth Edition, Chapters 13-14.

## Fallacies and Paradoxes of Vagueness

### Introduction to Fallacies

Hello and welcome to unit four of our course. In the last two units we've been focused on rules for good arguments, specifically in unit two we were focussed on rules. By means of which to evaluate and explain the validity of deductive arguments. And in unit three we were focused on rules by means of which to evaluate and explain the strength of inductive arguments. 

Now in unit four, we're not going to focus on good arguments. We're going to focus on bad arguments. Specifically we're going to focus on a kind of bad argument that's called a Fallacy. 

So what's a fallacy? 

Well, a fallacy is a kind of bad argument as I said, but not all bad arguments are fallacies. Some arguments are bad because their premises are false. 

But that's not why fallacies are bad. 

Of course, a fallacy could have false premises also. But that's not what makes an argument a fallacy. What makes an argument a fallacy is that its premises, whether they are true or false, don't support its conclusion. They're not the right kind of premises to support the conclusion that the argument draws. Whether they're true or false, so that's what makes a fallacy. Let me give you some examples. I'll show you what I have in mind. 

So consider this argument. 

The majority of violent crime in the United States is committed by men who earn less than $30,000 per year. 

By the way, that's true. 

Conclusion that the argument draws from that. Therefore when you see a man who earns less than $30,000 a year, he is likely to be a violent criminal, 

okay. Now that's a bad argument. 

But it's not a bad argument because its premise is false. But, actually its premise is true. So what makes it a bad argument? What makes it a bad argument, is that its premise doesn't support its conclusion. 

Right, the premise says that, most of the things that fall into, one category The category of perpetrators of violent crime in the United States also fall into a second category, the category of men who earn less than $30,000 a year. But then the conclusion says that most of the things that fall into that second category, the category of men who earn less than tha, $30,000 a year, also fall into that first category. The category of perpetrators of violent crime. 

And that conclusion isn't supported by the premise. Just because the majority of things in one category also fall into a second category. It doesn't mean that the majority of things in that second category also fall into that first category. 

So, that argument is a fallacy. And it's a fallacy. It's a bad argument, even though its premise is true. 

So that's one example of a fallacy. Here's another example of a fallacy. 

Consider this argument, premise one. If the national government increased the spending, investors will lose confidence in the national currency. 

Comes to, investors have lost confidence in the national currency. 

Conclusion, the national government must have increased spending. 

Okay, now, since the premises don't specify which nation we're talking about, we could imagine that there's some nation of which both of the premises are true. 

Right? We don't need to get into the details of which nation that would be, but imagine that there's some nation of which both of the premises are true. But even if both of the premises are true, concerning that nation, they don't support the conclusion. 

So this argument is a fallacy. It's a bad argument. Not because the premises are false. But because, even if the premises are true. They still don't support the conclusion. 

Right, the premises say, if one thing is true. Let's say if national government increases spending. Then a second thing is also going to be true. Investors will lose confidence. Then the second premise says that second thing is true. Investors have lost confidence, but the conclusion says so the first thing must be true, but that doesn't follow, right? Remember how conditionals work. 

Just because a conditional is true and it's consequence is true. It doesn't follow from that the antecedent of the conditional is true. 

You can see that from the, looking at the truth table for the conditional. So, this is an example of an argument. In which the premises don't support the conclusion. Even if the premises are true. So this argument is also a fallacy. 

Now, here's an example of a bad argument that's not a fallacy. Look at this one. most of the crude oil in the world is in Texas. So, that's premise one. Premise two, Texas is going to secede from the United States. So conclusion, domestic oil availability in the United States is going to plummet. Okay now this argument, although it's a bad argument, it's not a fallacy. It's not a fallacy because the premises really do support the conclusion. If both of those premises are true, then the conclusion has got to be true, right. If most of the crude oil in the world is in Texas, and Texas is going to secede from the United States, then domestic oil availability in the United States really is going to plummet. 

Thankfully for domestic oil availablity in the United States though. 

Those two premises are not true. In fact, neither of them is true. 

So in any case, I'm quite confident that neither of them is true. So this is a bad argument, not because the premises don't support the conclusion. They do support the conclusion. This is a bad argument because the premises aren't true. 

Okay, so I've given you examples of bad arguments that are fallacies and a bad argument that's not a fallacy. But, for a complete list of fallacies, anyhow a, a nearly complete list of fantasies, I recommend the URL. This URL is the entry on Wikipedia for a list of fallacies and it's a very long and nearly complete list of fallacies. 

So, you can look at that list, think about the different kinds of fallacies there are and we are going to describe them in more detail in this unit of the course. In this week in particular, in week nineof the course, we're going to focus on fallacies. That result from the misuse of expressions that are vague or ambiguous, okay. See you next time. 

你好 欢迎来到课程的第四单元 在过去的两个单元中 我们一直专注于研究 关于好的论证的规则 特别是在第二单元中 由此来评估和解释演绎论证有效性 在第三单元里 我们主要关注了 对于归纳论证的力度的评估和解释 

现在在第四单元 我们不会把重点放在好的论证上面 我们将专注于坏的论证 具体来说 我们要专注于一种 被称为谬论的论证 

那么 什么是谬论？ 

嗯，一个谬论是一种坏的论证 正如我刚才所说 但坏的论证不全是谬论。 有些论证不好 是因为它们前提为假 

但是 这并不是谬论不好的原因 

当然 一个谬论也可能有假前提 但是 并不是这个让一个论证变成谬论 使得一个论证成为一个谬论是当其前提 无论其是真是假 不支持其结论。 它们不是那种正确的前提 合适的前提 不管他们是真的还是假的 所以这是 使其成为谬论的原因 让我给你一些例子 我会把我脑子里的东西呈现给你们看 

请看这个论证 

在美国大部分的暴力犯罪 是每年收入不到30,000美元的人所犯下的 

顺便说一下 这是事实 

考虑以下这个结论 因此当你看到某人每年 收入不到30000美元 他很可能是一个暴力罪犯 

那么好 这是一个不好的论证 

这个论证不好的原因并非其前提为假 实际上它的前提是真的 那么 是什么让它成为了一个不好的论证呢？ 这不是一个好论证 是因为其前提是不支持其结论 

前提是说 大部分 落入一个范畴的事情 即在美国的暴力犯罪这个范畴 同样落入第二个范畴 即年收入少于30000美元这个范畴 但结论却说 落入第二个范畴的大部分事情 即年收入少于30000美元这个范畴 也落入第一个范畴 即暴力犯罪者的范畴 

这个结论并不被其前提所支持 如果第一范畴的大部分落入第二范畴 这并不意味着第二范畴的大部分 也落入第一范畴 

所以 这样的论证是一种谬论 它是一个谬论 是一个不好的论证 尽管其前提是真实的 

所以这是谬论的一个例子 下面是谬论的另一个例子 

考虑这样的论证 前提一 如果国家政府增加支出 投资者将失去对本国货币的信心 

而现在投资者已经对该国货币失去了信心 

结论是 国家政府一定已经增加了支出 

好 因为前提并没有明示我们讨论的是哪个国家 我们可以设想 有一些国家中 这两个前提都是为真的 

对么 我们并不需要真的知道是哪些国家 但试想 对有一些国家 这两个前提都是真实的 但是 即使这两个前提是真实的 关于这个国家 这些前提也不支持这样的结论 

因此 这种论证是一种谬论 这是一个不好的论证 不是因为其前提是假的 而是因为 即使前提是真实的 它们仍然不支持论证的结论 

好 前提说 如果一件事是真实的 比方说 如果国家政府增加支出 然后第二个事情也将是真实的 投资者将失去信心 然后第二个前提说 第二件事情是真实的 投资者已经失去了信心 但得出的结论是这么说的 第一件事必须是真实的 这并不能被推导出 对吧？ 请记住条件联结的用法 

仅仅因为一个条件是真实的而且它的结果是真实的 这并不能推出 条件联结的前件也为真 

你可以从条件句的真值表看出这一点 所以 这是一个论证的例子 其中的前提并不支持其结论 即使前提是真实的 这种论证也是一个谬论 

下面 这是一个坏的论证但不是谬论的例子 请看 世界上的大部分原油位于得克萨斯州 所以 这是前提一 前提二 德州想要脱离美国 所以结论是 美国国内石油供应量会直线下降 好了 这虽然是一个不好的论证 但这不是一个谬论 这不是谬论 因为其前提确实支持其结论 如果这两个前提为真 结论也一定为真 如果在世界上的大部分原油是在得克萨斯州 而且得克萨斯州要 脱离美国 那么美国国内成品油的产量  那么美国国内成品油的产量将会直线下降 

值得庆幸 对于美国国内成品油的产量来说 

这两个前提都不是真的 事实上 二者无一为真 

因此 在任何情况下 我非常有信心 它们都不是真实的 所以这是一个不好的论证 不是因为前提并不支持这样的结论 它们支持这样的结论 这是一个坏的论证 因为前提是不真实的 

好 我已经给出的论证的例子 其中有些是谬论 有些不是 但是 对于一个完整的谬误列表 一个近乎完整的谬论列表 我推荐这个网址 该网址是维基百科上的条目 “谬论” 这是一个很长 几乎完全的列表 

所以 你可以看看这个列表 想想有不同类型的谬论 我们要在本单元中更详细地描述它们 特别是在这一周中 在第九周 我们将专注于谬论。 以及滥用表达式所产生的含混不清的结果 下节课见

### Argument from the Heap

Although we're going to be focusing on fallacies in unit four today, I want to start off by talking about something that might or might not be a fallacy. But in any case, it exposes a linguistic phenomenon, that's called vagueness and that does create fallacies, okay. So what is the thing I'm going to talk about today? Well, it's a phenomenon I call the argument from the heap, or sometimes called the Seriates argument after the Greek word Soros, which means heap. 

What's the argument from the heap? Well let me give you an example. 

Consider the following argument, this is an example of the argument from the heap. Premise one, a person who owns only one penny, is poor. Premise two, a person who owns only one penny more than a poor person, is also poor. 

Conclusion, therefore, a person who owns a gazillion pennies, is poor. 

Now, 

why should we believe that those premises support that conclusion? Well, think of it this way. 

If premise one is true, then a person who owns only one penny, is poor. But if premise two is true, then it's going to follow that the person who owns two pennies is also poor, right? because they own only one penny more than a poor person and anyway that's obviously right. A person who owns only two pennies, is clearly poor. 

And then it's going to follow by premise two, that a person who owns three pennies is also poor, right. because they only own just one penny more than a poor person, so they're also going to be poor. 

And by premise two, it's also going to follow that a person who owns four pennies, is poor. 

Now, I hope you can see the pattern here, you can see where this is going. We can keep on applying premise two, to our results and we'll get that person who owns four pennies is poor, a person who owns five pennies is poor, a person who owns six pennies is poor, and we can go on and on and on, to a million pennies, a billion pennies, a trillion pennies, a quadrillion pennies, and even a gazillion pennies. Now, there's a name for that kind of reasoning, which was common in mathematics. It's called the principle of mathematical induction. The principal of mathematical induction says that, arguments of the following form are valid. 

where premise one says the number zero belongs to some category F. In our example the category of numbers, such that anyone who owns that number of pennies, is poor. 

If x belongs to F, then x plus one belongs to F, that's premise two. So in other words, that's saying that, if a particular number of pennies is such that anyone that owns just that number of pennies is poor, then adding one to that particular number of pennies, will also leave the person poor. 

And the conclusion is of the form all the natural numbers belong to 'F'. In other words, no matter how many pennies you own, you're still going to be poor. Right. All natural numbers belong to the category of numbers such that, a person owns that number of pennies is poor. 

That's the principle of mathematical induction, stated quite generally. 

Now, that principle, I'm quite confident is correct. Right, arguments of that form are valid. If arguments of that form weren't valid, then a whole lot of mathematics, the mathematicians accept today, would be false and I don't believe it is. So, the principle of mathematical induction, I'm prepared to say is correct. 

But then, what's going on in this argument? Right, if the principle of induction is correct, then it looks like, the argument is valid. 

So if the argument is valid, that means there's no possible way for the premises to be true, while the conclusion is false. 

So, is premise one true? Is it true that a person who owns only one penny is poor? 

It seems quite obviously, yes. Premise one is true. A person who owns only one penny, has got to be poor. There's no where in the world where one penny makes you rich. 

What about premise two? 

If you own just one penny more than a poor person, 

could you avoid being poor, by owning just one penny more than a poor person? 

I don't see how you can. 

One penny can't make the difference between being poor and not being poor. 

So it looks like premise two is true. 

But if the argument is valid and both of the premises are true, then that means the argument is sound. And remember, in a sound argument, that the conclusion has to be true. So let's consider the conclusion a person who owns a gazillion pennies, is poor. Is that true? Well, no. It's not true. I wish I owned a gazillion pennies. Owning a gazillion pennies, does not leave you poor. 

Someone who owns a gazillion pennies is very, very wealthy. So the conclusion seems to be obviously, false. So what's going on here? Well, in logic, this is what we call a paradox. A paradox is an argument, in which all of the premises of the argument seem to be obviously true, as in our argument from the heap. 

The argument seems to be obviously valid. Again, as in our argument from the heap, but the conclusion seems to be obviously false, again as in our arguments from the heap. So our argument from the heap is one example of a paradox, there are many other examples. 

Now some paradoxes are fallacies because despite appearances, even though they appear to be valid, they're really not. Really their arguments in which the premises don't support the conclusion, despite appearances. So some paradoxes are fallacies, 

but the question is, is this particular paradox a fallacy? Is the argument from the heap, a fallacy or is it just a paradox? And if it is a paradox, what's the solution? 

Should we say that a person could avoid being poor, even though they own only one penny? 

Should we say that you could avoid being poor by owning just one penny, more than a poor person? 

Or should we deny the principle of mathematical induction? 

Or should we say that, even if you owned a gazillion pennies, you're still poor? 

How should we solve this paradox? I'll leave that for you to think about. 

虽然我们今天将要聚焦于第四单元的谬论 我还是想 开始谈论一些其他的事物 这些事物可能是谬论 也可能不是 但是在任何一种情况下 它都暴露了一种语言现象 这就是所谓的模糊性以及这种模糊性导致了谬论的产生 那么 我今天的事情要说的是什么呢 好吧 这是一个现象 我称之为累积论证 或者有时也被称为连续 论证 这是在希腊文字索罗斯之后出现的 索罗斯的意思就是累积的意思 

什么是累积论证 好的 让我给你举个例子 

思考一下下面的论证 这是一个论证的例子 前提一 一个只拥有一个便士的人是贫穷的 前提二 一个人比一个穷人多一枚便士 一便士的人 仍是贫穷的 

结论是 因此 一个人拥有大量的便士 也是贫穷的 

现在 

我们为什么要相信那些前提能够支持这个结论呢 好吧 让我们从这个角度思考 

如果前提一是真实的 那么一个只有一便士的人是贫穷的 但如果前提二是真实的 那么它要遵循 拥有两个便士的人也是贫穷的 是不是？ 因为他们只比穷人多拥有一个便士 不管怎么样 这显然是正确的 一个人 仅仅拥有两个便士 他显然是贫穷的 

然后 这将跟随着前提二 即 一个拥有三个便士的人也同样是贫穷的 因为他们仅仅拥有多一个便士 因此他们也是贫穷的 

前提二 也可以继续说 一个有四便士的人也是贫穷的 

现在 我希望你能看到这里的模式 你可以看到这里 我们可以继续 将前提二适用到我们的结果上 我们将得到那个有四便士的人 是贫穷的 一个有五便士 六便士 也是贫穷的 并且我们可以继续 继续到一百万便士 一亿便士 便士，一万亿便士，一千的五次方亿便士，甚至极多数量的便士。 现在 有一个 可以称呼这种推理的名字 是在数学中常见的 这就是所谓的数学归纳法原则 数学归纳法主要说了 以下形式的论证是有效的。 

前提一说数字零属于某F类的论证 在我们的例子中 数字的类型 比如 任何拥有这个数字的便士的人 就是贫穷的 

如果x属于为F 那么x加一仍属于F 这是前提二 所以 换句话说 这即是说 如果一个特定的 数目的便士是这样的 任何仅仅拥有 这个数目便士的人是贫穷的 增加一个 到这个特定数目的便士上 这个人仍将会是贫穷的 

得出的结论是所有的自然数属于'F' 换句话说 不管你拥有多少便士 你仍旧将会变得贫穷 好的 所有自然数都属于数字这一类 一个拥有这个数目便士的人是贫穷的 

这就是数学归纳法的原则 以普遍形式被陈述 

现在 这个原则 我很有信心认为它是正确的 是的 这种形式的论证是有效的 如果这种形式的论证是无效的 那么所有这一大堆的数学 数学家今天所接受的这些数学 将会是错的 而我并不相信 因此 数学归纳法原则 我将认为它是正确的 

但之后 这个论证发生了什么呢？ 如果归纳法原则是正确的 那么看上去 这个论证是有效的 

所以 如果这个论证是有效的 这意味着不可能 出现前提为真结论为假的情况 

目前为止 我的想法是所以 前提一为真么？ 一个只有一便士的人就是贫穷的 这个前提为真么？ 

这似乎很明显是为真的 前提一为真 一个只拥有一个便士的人 不得不被称为穷人 在这个世界上没有任何一处地方可以用一便士让你致富 

前提二又如何呢？ 

如果你仅仅拥有一便士 

你能够通过仅仅一便士来避免贫穷 

我觉得你并不能 

一便士不能在贫穷与不贫穷之间产生影响 

所以前提二看上去似乎为真 

但是 如果论证是有效的 并且两个 前提均是真实的 那么这意味着这个论证是合理的 记住 在一个合理的论据里 结论必须为真 所以 让我们考虑一下一个拥有无以计数的便士的人是个穷人这个结论 这是真的吗？嗯 并不是 这并不为真 我希望我能拥有无数的便士 拥有极多数量的便士 你就不会贫穷 

一个拥有极多便士的人是非常 非常富有的 因此 这个结论看上去显然是假的 那么 在这里发生了什么呢？是这样的 在逻辑中 这被我们称为 一个悖论 悖论是一种论证 在这里所有的 前提看上去 都显然为真 就像我们上面的累积论证中的一样 

这个论证看上去似乎是有效的 再一次地，正如累积论证中所说 但结论似乎 显然是假的 这可以从上面我们的论证中显现出来 所以 我们的累积论证是一个 悖论的例子 关于此还有很多别的例子 

一些悖论是谬论 因为无论以怎样来呈现 即使它们看上去具有有效性 但它们真的并不具有 确实 他们的论证 无论以何种呈现形式 前提均不能支持结论 因此 一些悖论是谬论 

但是问题是，此处这个悖论是否是一个谬论呢？ 这个累积论证是一个谬论 还是仅仅是一个悖论？ 如果它是一个悖论 那么有什么解决办法呢？ 

我们是否可以说一个人可以避免 贫穷 即使他们仅仅拥有一个便士呢？ 

我们是否可以说你可以仅通过 通过拥有仅有的一便士从而能够避免贫穷 变得不仅仅是一个穷人？ 

或者我们是否能够否认数学归纳法的原则呢？ 

或者我们是否可以说 即使你拥有无以计数的便士 你仍旧是贫穷的？ 

我们如何解决这个悖论呢？我将留给你去思考 

### Vagueness

In the last class we talked about the argument from the heat, otherwise known as the Sorites argument. Today I want to describe the linguistic phenomenon that gives rise to that argument, gives rise to the paradox. Explain what that linguistic phenomenon is and why it gives rise to the paradox. The phenomenon is what's known as vagueness. 

So what's vagueness? Well, here's the definition along with some examples. So an expression is vague when there's no precise boundary between the cases to which that expression correctly applies and the cases to which it does not correctly apply. So, here's some examples. Poor, as we just saw in the last lecture. Bald, tall, accomplished, famous. Here, consider, what is the precise boundary line between baldness and non-baldness? Is there some precise line where if you have fewer hairs on your head than that then you're bald, but if you have more hairs on your head than that then you are not bald? No, there is no precise line. Baldness is vague. 

You could be more bald by having fewer hairs on your head. You can be less bald by heaving more hairs on your head. But baldness is vague. There's no precise line between baldness and non-baldness. How about tall? 

Is there some precise line where if you're taller than that then you're tall, but if you're shorter than that then you're not tall? 

No. Again, there's no precise line. Some people are taller than others, but there's no precise line where if you exceed that height, then you're tall. 

How about being accomplished? Is there some precise amount of accomplishment that you have to achieve in order to account as an accomplished person? No. Accomplished again is vague expression. There's no precise amount of accomplishment that's required in order for you to be an accomplished person. Clearly, some people are accomplished, but it's not clear exactly what the outlines of that category are. Some people are clearly included in that category. Some people are clearly not included in that category. But where exactly does that boundary line fall? 

That's not clear. It's vague. And again famous. How many people have to know who you are in order for you to be famous? Is Walter famous? Well someone might say sure, Walter's famous. Tens of thousands of students are taking his course. 

Yeah, but someone might say no, Walter's not famous, Tom Cruise is famous. 

So, how many people have to know who you are in order for you to be famous? 

It's not clear, it's vague. 

So those are some examples of vagueness. Examples of expressions that fit the definition of vagueness. 

Now, why do these expressions give rise to paradox? Give rise to the Sorites Paradox, the argument from the heap? 

Here's why. 

If there's no precise boundaries between cases to which an expression correctly applies and cases to which it does not correctly apply, then it's going to seem obviously true that making a minuscule change, just having a minuscule difference from a case to which an expression correctly applies or correctly doesn't apply, isn't going to make the difference between whether or not the expression correctly applies. Right? Having someone be just ever so slightly taller than a short person isn't going to make that person tall. If they're ever so slightly taller than a short person, they're still going to be short. If they're ever so slightly less famous than a famous person, they're still going to be famous. Right? It's going to seem that way as long as the boundary line between cases of correct application and cases of incorrect application is not clear. But the problem is that a series of minuscule differences or minuscule changes can add up to a big change. 

So, there could be a big change between two people, but if you just look at the minuscule changes it'll look like well, if one person isn't famous then the other one must not be famous. If one person isn't rich then the other person must not be rich. Again, because the minuscule differences are so minuscule that they seem not to involve crossing any threshold from cases of correct application to cases of incorrect application. Right? The differences are too small to allow for you to cross that threshold. Well, the reason is that the threshold isn't the precise one. 

So that's why it seems like when you have minuscule differences, they're not going to allow you to cross that threshold. If the threshold is fuzzy, then a minuscule difference isn't going to be enough to cross it. But, if you add up a whole bunch of minuscule differences and you get a big difference. A difference that is big enough to cross the threshold. 

So that's why vagueness leads to paradox, and here's some examples. 

Suppose someone says, well a person with no hair is bald. I mean clearly someone with no hair at all is bald, but someone with one more hair than a bald person is still bald. Right? It seems like if the only difference between you and me is that you have one more hair than I do, then if I'm bald, you must also be bald. Right? Someone who has only one more hair than a bald person is bald. 

But from those two premises, it follows by the principle of mathematical induction that someone with a billion hairs on their head is bald. I mean, I don't even know if it's possible to have a billion hairs on a human head, but if it is, presumably someone who did have a billion hairs on their head would not be bald. 

And yet, that conclusion follows validly from our two premises. 

Consider this other example. Someone who's only a meter in height is short. 

Right? A meter, for those of you who live in the United States, is about 39 inches. So someone who's only a meter in height is a short person. 

Now, you might think well someone who is only one millimeter taller then a short person is also short. If two people differ in height by a thousandth of a meter, then if one of them is short, you think the other one's gotta be short too. 

But from those two premises, again, it follows by the principle of mathematical induction that someone who's five meters tall is short, and that I can assure you is not true. Someone who's five meters tall, again for the benefit of people living in the United States, someone who's five meters tall is about a 195 inches tall. So that would be very, very tall. That would be taller than Dwight Howard. Okay, so again, why does this paradox arise? It arises because vagueness makes the second premise appear to be true. Vagueness makes it seem as if a minuscule difference between two things can't cross the threshold from correct application of an expression to incorrect application of an expression. 

So that's why the paradox arises. Okay, next time we'll see how the phenomenon of vagueness, how vague expressions can generate not just paradoxes, but also fallacies. See you next time. 

上一节课 我们讲了有关小麦堆 论证的内容 堆垛论证也被称为 连续体论证 今天我想讲的是 导致这种论证 或者说这种悖论的 语言现象 我会阐释这种语言现象的内容 以及其导致这种悖论的原因 这种现象被称为 模糊 

那么什么是模糊呢？ 好 下面是它的定义以及一些 例子 当一个表达正确指涉的群体 和错误指涉的群体 之间没有明确的界限时  这个表达就是模糊的 我来举一些例子 上一节课我们讲过贫穷 还有秃顶 高大 成就 名气 设想 秃顶和不秃顶之间的 明确界限是什么？ 是否存在这样一个界限 当你 的头发少于这个界限时 你就是秃顶 但是如果你的头发 比这个界限多 那么你就不是 秃顶 不 不存在明确的界限 秃顶是模糊的 实际上 你头上的头发越少 你就秃的越厉害 你头上的头发越多 你就越不会 秃顶 但是秃顶本身是模糊的 在秃顶和不秃顶之间没有明确的 界限 

那高大如何呢？ 是否存在一个明确的界限 当你 高于它  你就是高的 反之如果你矮于它 你就不高？ 

不是的 再次 不存在明确的界限 有些人比其他人高 但是并没有 明确的界限 当你超过了这个高度 你就是高的 

那关于成就又如何呢？ 是否存在一个明确的你需要 达成的数目 来使你被认定为一个 有成就的人呢？ 

不是的 熟练也是一个模糊的表达 并不存在一个明确的标准来衡量 你需要完成多少事情 才能成为一个有成就的人 很明显 有些人是某些方面的专家 

但是我们并不清楚这个范围的 界限是什么 有些人确实在这个范围内 而有些人明显不在 那个范围内 但是这个范围的界限 到底在哪里呢？ 

这是不明确的 是模糊的 我们在看有名这个表达 需要多少人认识你 才能算你有名呢？ 沃尔特有名吗？ 嗯 有些人可能会说 沃尔特 当然很有名 成千上万的 学生在上他的课 

是啊 但是有人可能会说 不 沃尔特不有名 汤姆克鲁斯才有名 

那么 有多少人认识你 才能算你有名呢？ 

这是不明确的 是模糊的 所以这是一些关于模糊的例子 一些 符合模糊定义的表达 那么 为什么这些表达 导致了悖论 导致了连锁悖论 堆垛悖论？ 

以下就是原因 

如果一个表达 与之相符的群体 和错误指涉的群体之间没有明确的界限 那么很明显 一个相符 和不相符的群体之间 只有极小的差别 从而并不会对这个表达是否相符 造成什么影响 嗯 某人只是比一个矮子搞、高 那么一点点 并不会使那个人变 高 如果他们只是比一个矮子 高了那么一丁点 他们仍然 是矮的 如果他们比一个有名的人 不出名了那么一丁点 他们仍然 是有名的 对吗？ 只要相符与不符的 的群体之间的界限 不明确 我们就可以一直这么推断下去 但是问题是一系列的 极小的差别或是改变 可以累积成巨大的改变 所以 即使两个人之间 有巨大的差别 但是如果你只是看那些 极小的差别 这两个人就会 看起来就差不多 如果一个人不有名那么 另一个也一定不有名 如果一个人不富有那么另一个人 也一定不富有 再次说明 因为那些极小的差别 是在太小 所以它们似乎 并不能跨越任何相符群体 和不符群体之间的 边界 对 这些差别小到不能 跨越那个边界 嗯 原因就是这个边界不甚明确 

所以这就是为什么当只有 极小的差别时 却不能跨越这个界限 的原因 如果这个界限是模糊的那么一个极小的 差别并不足以 跨越它 但当你把所有的 极小的差别累积起来 你就会 发现一个巨大的差别 这个差别已经大到足以跨越 这个界限 

所以这就是模糊会导致悖论的原因 我来举一些例子 

假设有人说 嗯 一个 没有头发的人是秃头 我是说 很明显一个没有头发的人确实是 秃头 但是比一个秃头多一根头发的人 仍然是秃头 确实 看起来如果 你我之间唯一的差别就是 你比我 多一根头发 那么如果我是秃头 你也 一定是秃头 对 一个比秃头只多一根头发的人 也是秃头 

但是从这两个前提出发 用数学归纳法的原理 可以推断一个有十亿根头发的人 也是秃头 我是说 我不知道一个人 是不是有可能有十亿根头发 但是如果有可能 假定一个人 的确有十亿根头发 他也不可能是秃头 

但是 这个结论是从我们的两个前提合理推断出来的 

再看另一个例子 一个只有一米高的人 是矮子 

嗯 对于住在美国的人来说 一米大概是39英寸 所以一个只有一米高的人 是个矮子 

现在你可能回想 好吧 一个 只比 一个矮子高一毫米的人 也是矮子 如果两个人的身高差距是由 千分之一米 那么如故 其中一个是矮子 你会觉得 另一个人也是矮子 

但是再次从这两个前提出发 遵循数学归纳法 的原理 一个五米高的 人也是矮子 关于这一点 我可以保证是不正确的 一个五米高的人 对住在美国的人 来说 一个五米高的人大约是 额 额 额 额 195英寸高 所以那是非常 非常高 那会比 Dwight Howard还要高 好了所以在此说明 为什么会出现 这个悖论？ 它出现的原因是模糊使得 第二个前提看上去是正确的 模糊使得两个事物之间的 极小差别似乎不能跨越 一个相符合不符的 群体之间的 界限 所以这就是悖论产生的原因 好了 下一次我们会讨论 模糊现象 模糊的表达是如何不仅仅造成 悖论 也能造成谬误的 下节课见 

## Slippery Slopes

### Conceptual Slippery Slopes

In the last lecture, we discussed the phenomenon of vagueness and saw why that phenomenon can lead to paradox. In this lecture and the ones to follow, I want to show how the phenomenon of vagueness can lead not just to paradox but also to fallacies. Today, we're going to talk about a particular kind of fallacy, called a conceptual slippery slope fallacy, that results from the phenomenon of vagueness. 

So what's a conceptual slippery slope fallacy? Well let me give you a definition. 

A conceptual slippery slope fallacy, is an argument, that exploits the vagueness of the category that's involved in the argument. In order to argue that there's there's no significant difference between things that belong to that category and things that don't belong to that category. 

Okay. So let me give you some examples of this definition. 

So here's one example, consider this argument premise one, a person who is one meter in height is short. 

Premise two, a difference of one millimeter is not a significant difference, certainly not a significant difference in human height, maybe it's a significant difference in some things, but not in human height. 

Premise three, a person who is two meters in height is tall. 

Conclusion, there's no significant difference between being short and being tall. 

Okay, now notice this is different than the argument from the heap. The argument from the heap would've gone from the premise that a person who's 1 meter in height is short to the conclusion that a person that is 2 meters in height, or 5 meters in height, or any height at all. Is also going to be short. That's not what this argument is saying. This argument allows that there's a difference between being short and being tall. But the difference just isn't significant because the difference is made up of a series of differences, each one of which is not significant. The difference between being one meter in height and being two meters in height is made up of a series of one millimeter differences and one millimeter differences are not significant differences in human height. 

So the argument concludes the 1 m difference in human height between the 1 m person and 2 m person, that 1 m difference in human height is itself not a significant difference. So there is no significant difference, the argument concludes, between being short and being tall. 

Okay now, that's a fallacy. 

And it's a fallacy, not because its premises are false. Actually its premises are, I think, not false, I think its premises are true. It's a fallacy because the premises don't support the conclusion. Remember that's what makes it a fallacy, is that the premises don't support the conclusion, even if they are true. 

Why don't the premises support the conclusion? Well here's why. The conclusion says that a height difference of one meter is not significant 

and the premises say that a height difference of one millimeter is not significant and of course a height difference one meter is made up of a series of a thousand height differences of one milimeter, but just because a millimeter height difference is not significant. And a meter height difference is made up of a 1000 one millimeter height differences. It doesn't follow that a one meter height difference is not significant. Differences that are significant can be made up out of a bunch of difference that are individually insignificant. 

So that's why this argument right here is a fallacy. Consider another example to illustrate the same point. 

A person who owns only one penny is poor. 

A difference of one penny is not a significant difference in human wealth. You don't become significantly wealthier or less wealthy by gaining or losing a penny. A person who owns a gazillion pennies is not poor they're rich. 

Well, from those three premises this argument concludes, there is no significant difference between being poor and being rich, okay. Once again the argument start off three premises each of which is quite plausibly true. I think it is true. 

But then it draws a conclusion and that's ridiculous. 

Well why? Well, it's because the argument is one in which the premises don't really support the conclusion. So even if the premises are true they don't support the conclusion. They don't give us good reason to believe that the conclusion is true. 

And that's because even if the difference between being poor and being rich is made up out of a series of one penny differences and even if a one penny difference is insignificant, it doesn't follow that the difference between being poor and being rich is insignificant, right? A difference that made up out of a bunch of insignificances can still itself be significant. Just because it's components are insignificant doesn't mean that it is insignificant. 

Compare this to the following point. Just because each person in a group is not powerful, does that mean that the group is not powerful? No. Sometimes, composites, collections, can have properties, can have features, can belong to categories that their individual members don't have, don't belong to, right? So even if each individual member of a group is not powerful that doesn't mean the group is not powerful and similarly even if each one penny component of the difference between poverty and wealth is not a significant difference. That doesn't mean that the complete difference, the series of one penny differences Is not a significant difference. So that's why this is a fallacy, right? These arguments, which we'll call conceptual slippery slope arguments, are arguments in which the premises could all be true. There are many conceptual slippery slope arguments in which the premises are all true. But the premises don't support the conclusion. 

And, what make the argument tempting it the vagueness 

of the category that the argument makes use of, the category of tall, the category of poor, whatever category it is that the argument makes use of. If it's a vague category, then you can construct a conceptual slippery slope argument that uses that category. 

In the next lecture we'll see how vague categories can give rise to other slippery slope arguments as well. 

在上一讲中 我们讨论含糊不清的现象 了解为什么这一现象可能会导致悖论 在这一讲及后续视频中 我想说明 含糊不清的现象是怎样导致矛盾以及谬论的 今天 我们要谈论特定种类的谬论​​ 被称为 概念性滑坡谬误 是由含糊现象导致的 

那么 什么是概念性滑坡谬论？ 好吧 让我给你一个定义 

概念滑坡谬误利用了 论证涉及范畴的模糊性 从而得以论证 范畴内的事物与范畴外的事物 没有显著差异 

好了 所以让我给你一些关于这个定义的例子 这里有个例子 考虑这种说法 前提一：身高一米的人是矮的 

前提二：一毫米的差别 毫米不是一个显著的区别 在人类身高上这当然不是一个显著的差异 也许在某些事情上十分显著 但不是在人类身高上 

前提三：身高两米的人是高的 

结论：高和矮之间 没有显著差别 

好了 注意到 这与之前的论证不同 之前的论证 会从一米高的人是矮的前提出发得出 两米或五米或其他高度的人 或者任何身高的人都是矮的这样的结论 这个论证说的不是这么回事 这个论证允许高与矮之间存在差别 但差异不明显 由于这种差别是由一系列 每一个均不显著的差异组成 一米高与两米高的区别 是由 一系列一毫米的差异组成 对于人类来说 身高上的毫米之差并不显著 

因此 论证的结论是人的一米的身高差 身高一米 与身高两米 这之间的一米差距并不显著 因此 论证得出结论 在高和矮之间 没有显著的差异 

好了 这是一个谬论 

这是一个谬论 不是因为它的前提是假的 事实上 我认为前提不是假的 我认为它的前提为真 这是一个谬论 因为前提并不支持这样的结论 记住 谬论形成的原因就在于 前提不支持结论 即使前者为真 

为什么前提无法得出 这就是原因 结论说 一米身高差是不显著的 

前提说 一毫米的高度差是不显著的 当然 一个一米的高度差是由 1000个一毫米的高度差累积而成 但仅仅因为一个毫米的高度差 不显着 由1000个一毫米高度差 构成了一米的高度差 并不服从一米的高度差不显著的论断 显著的差异可以由 大量单个看并不明显的差异组成 

所以 这就是为什么此处 这个论证是谬误的原因 来看 说明这一点的 另一个例子 

一个只有一分钱的人是穷人 一分钱之差不是 人类财富一个显著区别 你不会因为获得或失去一分钱变得十分富有或穷困 而一个人若是有极大数量的一分钱 不是穷人 是富人 

那么 由上述三个前提 这种说法 得出结论 贫穷和富裕 没有显著的差异 

好了 这次论证又是以三个前提开始 每一个都相当言之成理 我认为它是真的 

但随后得出的结论却是荒谬的 

那么 这是为什么呢？ 嗯 这是因为在论证中 前提并不能得出结论 因此 即使前提是真实的 它们仍无法推出结论 它们没有提供充足的理由 使我们相信 得出的结论是真实的 

那是因为 即使贫富之间的差异 可以看成诸多一分钱差异的总和 即使一分钱的差异是微不足道的 也推不出 贫穷和富有之间的差异是微不足道的 对不对 由大量细微差异的集合 导致的差别 本身仍可能是显著的 只是因为该差异由细微差异构成 并不意味着它是微不足道的 

将此与下面的观点比较 仅仅因为一组中的每个人不够强大 这是否意味着该组不够强大？ 不是的 有时候 复合体和集合 可以具备 它们单个成员不具有 不属于的 性质 特征 以及涉及的范畴 对么 因此 即使一组中的每个成员  并不意味着该组也很弱 同样 即使贫富间 每一分钱的差异 都很小 微不足道 也不表示聚合后的差异 这大量一分钱累积的差异 是不显著的 所以这就是为什么这是谬论 对吧 这些论证 我们称之为概念性滑坡论证 均是前提为真的论证 有许多概念性滑坡论证 其前提均为真 但前提却并不能支持推出的结论 

论证范畴的含糊不清 导致论证具有迷惑性 包括 高的范畴 贫穷的范畴等等 等等论证使用到的范畴 如果它是一个模糊的范畴  那么你就可以依此构建一个的概念性滑坡论证 

在下一讲中 我们将看到含糊的范畴 会怎样导致其他滑坡论证的发生 

### Fairness Slippery Slopes

In the last lecture we saw how the phenomenon of vagueness gives rise to a kind of fallacy that we called a conceptual slippery slope. 

Today we're going to see how that same phenomenon of vagueness gives rise to another kind of fallacy. This kind of fallacy we're going to call the fairness slippery slope. It's also kind of slippery slope argument, but it concerns fairness. 

Okay, so what's a fairness slippery slope argument? 

Well, here's the definition. A fairness slippery slope argument is one that exploits the vagueness of a category, to argue that it's unfair to treat cases that fall into that category differently from cases that don't fall into that category. 

So what's an example of that? Here's one example. 

So suppose I argue as follows. Premise one, a person who scores 100% on the exam passes. If any score passes 100% must pass. So let's suppose a person who scores 100% on the exam passes. Well, a difference of .01% is not a significant difference. 

Therefore, the argument concludes, it's not fair to fail someone who scores a 10% on the exam. In fact, it's unfair to fail someone who scores a 0% on the exam. 

Now how does that thinking go? Well it goes like this. If a person who scores 100% passes, and there's no significant difference between the person who scores 100% and this person who scores 99.99%, then it's not fair to fail someone who scores 99.99%. But then for the same reason it's also not going to be fair to fail someone who scores 99.98%. And then for the same reason it's not going to be fair to fail someone who scores 99.97%. And so on, all the way down the scale. 

Right it can't be fair to fail them because there's no significant difference between that score, and a score that's 0.01% higher. So that's a fairness slippery slope argument. Now why is this a fallacy? Well it's a fallacy because it assumes that it can't be fair to fail someone whose score is not significantly different from a passing score, right? If a score of 70% is passing, then by premise two, a score of 69.99% is not significantly different from that. But it doesn't follow just because 69.99% is not significantly different from 70%, it doesn't follow that it's not fair to fail someone, who got a 69.99%. It could perfectly well be fair to fail them for all the two premises say. 

Right, fairness doesn't necessarily go with significant differences. It could go let's say with predictable differences. Right, if I tell you in advance, that the minimum score for passing the test is 70%, than even though there's not a significant difference between 69.99% and 70% still you knew in advance that 70% was the minimum score for passing the test, so if you get a 69.99%, it might be fair to fail you even though that score is not significantly different from 70%. Okay. So that's why fairness slippery slope arguments are fallacies, they're fallacies is because they assume something that might not be true, which is that it can't be fair to fail someone who has a score that's not significantly different from a passing score. So that's why these are fallacies. Let's look at another example. 

So premise one, a nine month old human fetus, let's say a human fetus that's almost to its due date, or maybe on its due date, has a right to live. 

I think we might all agree with that. 

Premise two, a difference of one minute of pre-natal development is not a significant difference. 

We might all agree with that too. 

Conclusion of this fairness slippery slope agreement, it's not fair to deny a fertilized egg the right to live. 

Okay, but once again, that doesn't follow from the premises. I'm not saying it's not true, the conclusion of that argument might for all I'm going to say today, might very well be true. My point is not whether it's true or false. My point is that the conclusion is not supported by the premises. And the reason it's not supported by the premises is because this argument assumes, again, that it can't be fair to deny a prenatal life the right to live. 

If it's not significantly different from a prenatal life that does have the right to live. 

Again, it assumes the differences in fair treatment have to be significant differences. 

And again, that might very well not be true. 

So that's why this is a fairness slippery slope argument. That's why this is a fallacy. 

Okay. Now let me say in general when someone gives a fairness slippery slope argument in ordinary life, they usually don't lay it out in the way that I'm laying out these arguments. Usually what they do is say something like, well, where do you draw the line? Where that question is not understood so much as a sincere question as rather a pointed question. It's a question. Question they're asking of which is simply an attempt to make a point. They're simply trying to make a point that there's no reasonable way to draw a line that needs to be drawn. So when asking that question, someone is in effect assuming that because little differences are not significant, it can't be fair to treat those slightly different cases, those insignificantly different cases differently. So when you hear someone ask, where do you draw the line? Often you should beware, because a fairness slippery slope fallacy might be lurking in the midst. Okay, see you next time. 


在上一讲中 我们看到模糊不清的现象如何 造成一种谬论 我们称之为概念滑坡谬论 

今天 我们将要看到同样模糊不清的现象如何 导致另一种谬论 这种谬论我们称之为公平滑坡谬论 它也是其中一种滑坡谬论论证 但是它牵涉到到公正性 

好 所以什么是公平滑坡论证呢 好 这就是定义 公平滑坡论证是一种利用 一类事物的模糊性去辩论那些 它对待一些属于类别的事例 和没有落入类别内的事例是不公的 

所以 那个的例子是什么呢 

这里有一个例子 好 假设我如下论证 前提一 某人在考试中拿了100分 好 如果任意的分数达到100%就肯定会过考试 那让我们 假设一个人在考试中得到100% 那么 0.01%的不同就没有太明显的区别 

因此 论证的结论是  它是不公平的 对测试中得到10%分数的人无效 事实上 它是不公平的 对在考试中得到0%分数失败的人  

现在 那如何去思考 它是这样的 如果某人100%的分数通过 那么就没有显着的区别 相对于某人得到100%和某人得到99.99%来说 那么对于某人得到99.99%分失败的人就是不公平 

但是由于同样的理由 它同样 对得到99.98%的人是不公平的 然后 同理 它对得到99.97%的人也是不公平的 对得到99.97%的人来说 等等 所有的降下来的比例都是这样 【果壳教育无边界字幕组】翻译：卡诺上的泡沫 校对：霁蓝 审阅：霁蓝 好 让他们不及格不公平 因为 在分数之间0.01%的差别是不明显的 

这就是公平滑坡论证 现在 为什么它是谬论 它是谬论因为他假设它不能 公平地区分某人取得的分数和及格分数的不同 如果70%的分数 是可以通过的 那么根据前提二 得到69.99%是跟 得到70%的分数是没有区别的 但是它并不是这样 只是因为69.99%和70%没有太大的区别 它不遵守对于取得69.99%失败的人是不公平的 这完全是不公平的 因为这两个前提说过 

好 公平性不一定就有着显着区别 它可以说是伴随着可预见的差异 没错 如果我事先告诉你 通过测试的最低分数是70%  那么 尽管没有显着的区别在69.99%和 70%之间 你还是事先知道70% 是考试及格的最低分数 所以如果你得了69.99% 让你不及格就是公平的 尽管69.99%和70%并没有明显区别 好 这就是为什么公平性滑坡论证是谬论 它们是谬论因为假设的事情可能不是真的 就是让考试分数和及格分数没有明显区别的人 不及格是不公平的 这就是为什么这些是谬论 让我们看下其他例子 前提一 一个九个月大的人类胚胎 也就是胎儿 胎儿快到预产期或者在预产期 是有生存的权利 

我觉得我们可能都会同意这个观点 

前提二 一分钟的 胎儿发育的差异是不是一个显着的区别 

我们也可能都会同意这个观点 

公平滑坡论证的结论是  对于一个受精卵的生存权的否定是不公平的 

好 但再次 通过前提并不能推导出这样的结论 对么 我不会 说它不正确 论证的结论可能  对于我今天要说的 可能都是对的 我要说的不是它是否是真还是假 我要说的是结论不是由前提所支撑的 而不是有前提支撑的原因是因为这个论证的假设 再一次 它不能够公平对待否定一个胎儿的生存权 如果没有显着区别对于 胎儿确实有生存权 

再一次 它假设 公平对待中的不同一定要有显著不同 

那么再次 它很可能不是真的 

所以这就是为什么这是公平滑坡论证 这就是为什么它是谬论 

好的 现在 我们简单地说就是 当某人 给了一个日常生活中的公平滑坡论证 它们通常不会按照我正在安排的这些论证来展示 通常他们所做的是说一些相似的东西 也就是你们区分界限的地方 

也就是那个问题并不是一个真正的问题都 而作为一个具有指向性的问题 这是一个问题 他们问这就是企图提出观点 他们就是尝试提出一个观点 一个没有合理的方式来区分需要划清界限的观点 所以当问起那问题 某人 事实上 就是假设这样因为细微的区别不是什么很明显的事情 它不能够 公平地对待这有些细微不同的 事例 这些微不足道的不同情况不同 所以当你听到某人问起 你是如何去划清界限的 你应该注意到因为公平滑坡 谬论可能会潜伏在其中

### Causal Slippery Slopes

In the last two lectures, we saw how the phenomenon vagueness gives rise to a couple different kinds of fallacy, the conceptual slippery slope fallacy and the fairness slippery slope fallacy. Today, I'd like to describe another kind of fallacy that arises because of the phenomenon of vagueness. We're going to call this the causal slippery slope fallacy. 

So whats a casual slippery slope fallacy? Well here's the definition. Casual slippery slope fallacy or casual slippery slope argument, right, because all fallacies are arguments, a casual slippery slope argument is one that exploits the vagueness of a category to argue that a particular event that you're considering, may be a course of action that you're considering performing, or maybe just an event that you're imagining. A particular event will lead to a calamity that's causally connected to that event by a series of steps. 

So, sometimes this is called a domino argument. Sometimes, it's called a parade of horrors. The idea is there's a series of steps that eventually leads to some calamity. And so, we should cut off that series of steps before it begins, we should prevent it from even beginning because if we allow it to begin then it will eventually lead to some calamity. That's the form that a causal slippery slope argument takes. 

So what are some examples of causal slippery slope arguments and why are they fallacies? Well here are some examples. 

So consider this, premise one if we let doctors euthanize patients under any circumstances whatsoever, it's likely, not certain,but likely, that we'll eventually let doctors kill patients who are depressed or in severe pain. 

Independently of whether or not their condition is terminal or hopeless. 

Premise two, if we let doctors kill patients who are depressed or in severe pain, then it's very likely that we'll eventually let doctors kill patients who are a nuisance. Premise three, doctors should not be allowed to kill patients who are a nuisance, right. Simply being a nuisance shouldn't license a doctor to kill you. 

In conclusion, doctors should not be allowed to euthanize patients. 

So there's a causal slippery slope argument. What it tells us is that if we allow euthanasia, then that's going to have a certain likely consequence, which in turn would itself have a certain consequence which would be unacceptable. So we shouldn't allow euthanasia, because of the indirect consequences of allowing euthanasia. 

Now why is that not a good argument why is that a fallacy? 

Here's why it's a fallacy. 

Just because one event is likely to have a certain result 

and that result Is likely itself to have a certain result, it doesn't follow that the first event is likely to have that last result. 

Consider this example, suppose that dating leads to marriage with a 66% of probability, right 66%, I'm just making this up obviously. But let's suppose that 66% of couples that date end up getting married. 

Now let's suppose that 66% of married couples get divorced. 

And let's suppose that 66% of divorced couples end up not being on speaking terms with each other. 

Okay, so it's likely that if you're dating you'll get married, it's likely that if you get married you'll get divorced and it's likely that if you get divorced then you won't be on speaking terms with each other. 

Let's suppose. Does it follow from that that it's likely that if you're dating, then eventually you won't be on speaking terms with each other? 

From the premises I just gave, it doesn't follow from the fact that you're dating right now that you'll eventually end up not being on speaking terms with each other. It doesn't even follow that it's likely that you'll end up not being on speaking terms with each other. 

Right, just because each event in the chain is likely given the one before it. It doesn't mean the last event in the chain is likely given the first event in the chain. Because the probability could reduce at each point in the chain. And if the probability reduces just a couple times, it could go from being, something could go from being likely to being unlikely. 

Here's another example of a causal slippery slope argument. 

Okay, let's suppose I say, premise one, if we allow the distribution of birth control in colleges, then it's likely that we will allow it in high schools eventually. 

Premise two. If we allow the distribution of birth control in high schools, then, it's likely that eventually, we'll allow it in elementary schools. 

Premise three. We should not allow the distribution of birth control in elementary schools. 

Conclusion. We should not allow the distribution of birth control in colleges. 

Okay, why is that a fallacy? Why don't the premises support the conclusion? Just because each step in that series is likely given the preceding step, it doesn't follow that the last step in the series is likely given the first step in the series. In other words, just because it's likely that will allow distribution of birth control in high schools given that we allow it in colleges and its likely that we'll allow it in elementary schools given that we allow it in high schools. It doesn't follow from that it's likely that we'll allow it in elementary schools given that we allow it in colleges. Likelihood is not transitive in that way. That's why cause a slippery slope arguments are fallacies. That doesn't mean that their conclusions are never true, their conclusions could well be true. But again, what were talking about here is whether or not a causal slippery slope argument gives good support for its conclusion. And the point I'm making today is, that it doesn't. A causal super slope argument, while it might be arguing for a true conclusion, doesn't give a good reason for accepting that conclusion. 

Okay, so that's wrap up the topic of vagueness and the fallacies to its vagueness gives rise. In the next lecture, we'll talk about a different phenomenon, something that we call call ambiguity. And we'll consider the fallacies to which ambiguity gives rise. See you next time. 

在上两节课中 我们看到了 由模糊造成的不同种类的谬论 概念上的超级斜坡谬论和关于公平的超级斜坡谬论 今天 我要描述的是另一种 因为模糊而产生的谬论 我们要称其为因果滑坡谬论 

那么 什么是因果滑坡谬误？ 

这是 它的定义 因果滑坡谬误或因果 滑坡论证 因为所有的谬论都是论证 因果滑坡论证也是论证之一 利用一类事物的模糊性去论证 某特定事件 这个事件可能是 当前你准备做的事 也可能只是你假想的一个事件 这个特定的事件将 通过一系列因果关连的步骤而最终导致灾难 

所以有时这被称为多米诺骨牌论证 有时也被称作恐怖大游行 我们的想法是 既然这个事件经过一系列的步骤后必将导致灾难 那么 我们应该在这一系列步骤开始前切断其源头 我们应该从最开始防止这一系列步骤发生 因为一旦我们允许其开始 那么它最终将导致灾难 这就是一个因果滑引坡论证的形式 

那么 因果滑坡论证有哪些例子呢? 他们为什么是谬论呢？ 这里有一些例子 比如这一个 

前提一 如果我们允许 在任何情况下 医生都可以使病人安乐死 那么 有可能 虽然不能确定 但是有可能 最终会导致医生 杀死那些绝望或剧烈疼痛的病人 

不论他们有无医治的希望 

前提2 如果我们允许医生杀死绝望或剧烈疼痛的病人 那么 很有可能最终导致 医生杀死讨厌的病人 前提 三 医生不应该被允许杀死讨厌的病人 对吧 仅仅因为你讨厌 不足以使医生有资格杀死你 

结论就是 我们不应该允许医生使病人安乐死 好了 所以这就是一个因果滑坡论证 这个论证说明 如果我们允许安乐死 那么有可能造成某些后果 而这后果本身会导致不可接受的后果 所以 我们不应该允许安乐死 这是因为允许安乐死将导致的间接后果 

那么 为什么这不是一个好的论证？为什么这是一个谬论？ 

我们将解释为什么这是一个谬论 仅仅因为 某个事件可能导致一个确定的结果 并且这个结果 本身可能导致特定的结果  但是我们不能说这个事件本身可能导致最终的结果 考虑这个例子 

假设约会导致婚姻 的概率是66％ 这明显是我捏造的数据 但是暂且让我们假设66％的约会对象最终会结婚 

现在 让我们再假设66％的已婚夫妇会离婚 

并且假设 66％的夫妻离婚是因为 彼此无话可说 

好了 如果你们约会 那么很有可能你们会结婚 如果你们结婚 那么很有可能你们会离婚 如果你们离婚 那么很有可能 是因为你们彼此无话可说 

就让我们这么假设 那么是否可以得出这样的推论? 如果你们约会 最终你们会彼此无话可说 

根据我刚刚给出的前提 并不能得出这样的推论 你们现在正在约会 无法得出你们最终会 无话可说的结论 也无法得出你们最终可能 彼此无话可说的结论 没错 仅仅因为事件链中的每个事件在前一个事件发生的前提下都有可能发生 并不意味着 在事件链中第一个事件发生的前提下 最后一个事件会发生 因为概率在事件链中的每个点上都会降低 即使概率只是降低了几次 也可能导致事件从很可能发生变成不大可能发生 

下面是因果滑坡论证的另一个例子 

好吧 让我们假设 我指的是前提一 如果我们允许在高校中设置节育设施 那么 很可能我们最终将允许在中学设置 

前提二 如果我们允许在中学设置节育设施 那么很可能我们最终将允许在小学设置 

前提三 我们不应该允许 在小学设置节育设施 

所以结论是 我们不应该允许在高校中设置节育设施 

同样的 为什么这是一个谬论呢？ 为什么前提不支持结论? 仅仅因为该系列中的每一步骤 在其上一步骤成立的前提下可能成立 并不意味着该系列中的最后一个步骤在该系列中的第一个步骤成立的前提下可能成立 换句话说 仅仅因为 如果我们允许在高校中设置节育设施 我们可能会允许在中学设置 如果我们允许在中学设置 那么我们可能会允许在小学设置 但是无法得出这样的推论  如果我们允许在大学中设置不能得出我们可能在小学设置的结论 可能性不能以这种方式传递 这就是为什么因果滑坡论证是谬论 这并不意味着他们的结论 永不为真 他们的结论可能是正确的 但是同样的 我们在这里讨论的是 一个因果滑坡论证是否很好地支持其结论 今天我给出的观点是它并没有 一个因果滑坡论证 即使它可能是在论证 一个正确的结论 也无法给出一个很好的理由使我们接受这样的结论 

好了 这里包含了 模糊和由模糊产生的谬误这两个话题 在下一节课中 我们将谈谈 一个不同的现象 我们称之为歧义的东西 我们会考虑由歧义产生的谬误 下节课见 

## Ambiguity

### Ambiguity

Today, we're going to talk about the phenomenon of ambiguity. And how that phenomenon, like the phenomenon of vagueness, can give rise to fallacies. Okay. So first, what's ambiguity? Well, here's a definition, along with some examples. 

ambiguity is when an expression has more than one acceptable interpretation, more than one correct interpretation. So, some examples of this. there are cases where a single word has more than one correct interpretation. So consider the word bank. In English, a bank could be a financial institution, an institution, which you could deposit money, invest money, on which you can write checks and so forth. Or a bank could be the edge of a river, a river bank. 

Consider the word cardinal, cardinals are members of the Papal hierarchy, they're below the Pope, but they're higher than priests. so that's one interpretation of cardinal. But there's another interpretation of cardinal. well, actually there are several other interpretations of cardinal. A cardinal could be a kind of red finch. a particular kind of bird. A cardinal could also be a St. Louis baseball player, a player for the St. Louis baseball team. 

and there's also a use of cardinal as an adjective, not as a noun. 

These are examples of single words that have more than one acceptable interpretation in English. But sometimes you have a whole phrase or a sentence that has more than one acceptable interpretation. So for instance, consider the sentence, she is an Asian historian. 

Well, there are two perfectly good interpretations of that sentence. Depending on the situation in which it's used. It might be saying that she is an Asian person who is a historian. Or it might be saying that she's a historian of Asian history. She studies the history of Asia. 

consider the sentence, Police kill man with ax. 

Well, there are at least two different ways of understanding that sentence. It could be understood as saying that there's this man with an ax and the Police killed him, or it could be understood as saying that the Police killed that man. And they killed him by using an ax. Again, two acceptable but very different interpretations of the same sentence. 

Okay. So, why does ambiguity, why does this phenomenon of ambiguity? Which I should stress is very widespread, not just in English, but in every spoken language. Why does the phenomenon of ambiguity give rise to fallacies? Here's why. 

If an expression has two acceptable interpretations, and we switch between those two interpretations in the course of a single argument, we switch between them mid-argument. Then we can construct an argument that might seem valid. But it is invalid. 

Let me give you some examples to illustrate this possibility. So here is one example. suppose I reason as follows. Well, Jones, I'm told was sentenced to nine years in the violin case. 

Now you might think, well our criminal justice system is not supposed to sentence anyone to spend time inside a violin case. And therefore Jones's sentencing was a breach of justice. What's very likely to be going on in this example is that the interpretation of sentence to nine years in the violin case is different in the first premise than it is in the second premise. In the first premise, when I say Jones, I'm told, was sentenced to nine years in the violin case, I don't mean that Jones was sentenced to spend time inside the violin case. I mean that Jones was sentenced to spend nine years in prison. 

And he was sentenced to do that in a particular criminal case. That I'm referring to the Violin case, maybe it was a case in which an expensive violin was stolen and it was stolen through armed robbery. And Jones was found guilty of armed robbery of the violin and then sentenced to spend nine years in prison. So, that's what I probably mean, when I say something like premise 1. But premise 2 interprets the phrase, sentenced to nine years in the violin case. In another way, it interprets that phrase as saying Jones was sentenced to spend nine years of his life inside a violin case. 

Okay. Now, clearly premise 1, when properly understood, could very well be true and premise 2, when properly understood could very well be true. 

But the reason the conclusion doesn't follow from those two premises, the reason this is a fallacy. Is because the correct understanding of, sentence to spend nine years in the violin case in premise 1 is different from the correct understanding of that same phrase in premise 2. So premise 1 and premise 2 together don't imply anything about Jones's sentencing being a breach of justice or being a violation of the rules of our criminal justice system That phrase means something different in the two premises. 

So that's why we have a fallacy here. Superficially, the argument might look valid. But actually, it's a fallacy, it's not a valid argument. 

Here's another example. Suppose I say Amelia Bedelia was told to dress the chicken for dinner. 

Right, those of you who are familiar with the Amelia Bedelia stories, these are children stories about a servant who's given a set of instructions and interprets them all differently than the way they're intended. So one of her instructions was to dress the chicken for dinner. 

And clearly the woman who told Amelia Bedelia to dress the chicken for dinner was understanding the word dress in a particular way. Such that it's a way of preparing a chicken to be cooked for dinner. 

Well, Amelia Bedelia hears the instructions and then goes off for some dinner clothes that are just small enough to fit the chicken. 

And turns out, she can't find dinner clothes that are small enough, to fit the chicken. Either the family just doesn't have dinner clothes that are that small in their house. 

So Amelia Bedelia could not find dinner attire small enough to fit the chicken. So you might conclude from those two premises that Amelia Bedelia was not able to do what she was told, she wasn't given the resources to follow her instructions. [SOUND]. But that's false. 

What happened is that Amelia Bedelia misunderstood the instructions. The instructions were intended to be understood in one way. And Amelia Bedelia understood them in a different way. 

And so, while this argument might superficially appear to be valid. In fact, it isn't valid at all. Again, this argument trades on an ambiguity in the phrase dress. Dress the chicken for dinner. 

Right? There's two possible interpretations of that phrase. The instructions that Amelia Bedelia was given had one interpretation that was correct. But Amelia Bedelia's understanding of those instructions relied on the alternative interpretation, the interpretation that was incorrect. And so it seems to Amelia Bedelia, as if she couldn't carry out her instructions, but that's because she misunderstood the instructions. She gave them one interpretation when they were suppose to have the other. Okay. So these are some examples of ambiguity and how ambiguity can give rise to fallacies. In the next lecture, we'll talk about a couple different kinds of ambiguity. And we will look at examples of each of those kinds. See you next time. 

今天 我们要讨论歧义现象 这类情况与模糊现象一样 均可能导致谬误 好 那么首先 什么是歧义？ 这里是歧义的定义 还有几个例子 

当一个表达有多种合理的正确的解读时 就存在歧义 那么 这里有几个例子 每个例子中的单词会有多种正确的解读方式 那么来看这个单词bank 在英语中 bank这个词可以表示一个金融机构 你可以存钱 进行投资 开支票 诸如此类 此外 bank还可以表示某条河的边缘 即河岸 

来看cardinal这个单词 cardinal (枢机) 是教会制度中的一个阶层 他们地位低于教皇 但是高于祭司 那么这是cardinal的一种解释 而这个单词还有另一种意思 好吧 事实上cardinal有多个意思 cardinal可能指一种红雀 一种特别的鸟类 cardinal还可以指圣路易斯棒球队球员 该球员效力于圣路易斯棒球队 

cardinal还可以作为形容词而非名词使用 

上述例子举的都是英语中 具有多个意思的单词 不过有时 你会遇到一个完整的短语或是句子 也会有多种含义 例如例如 看这样一个句子 She is an Asian historian 

好吧 这个句子可以有两种解释 每种都说得通 而采用哪种理解 取决于句子的语境 也许是说她是亚洲人 并且是一位历史学家 抑或是说 她是研究亚洲历史的历史学家 她的专业领域是亚洲历史 

还有这个例子 Police kill man with axe 

而针对这个句子 至少有两种不同的理解 可以将其理解为 一个男人拿着把斧头 然后警察干掉了他 或者可以理解为 警察干掉了那个男人 用的是一把斧头 同样 这里同一个句子有两种完全不同的解读 

好 那么 为什么会有歧义 为什么会出现歧义的情况？ 我必须强调 这个现象十分普遍 不仅在英语中 在其他所有语言中都会出现 为什么这类歧义会导致谬误？ 为什么呢 

如果一种表达有两种合理的解释 并且在某个单一论证时 我们可以在两种解释之中切换 我们在论证期间游移于两种解释之间 然后我们可以构建一个看上去有效的论证 事实上该论证是无效的 

我来举几个例子 给你们解释这种可能性 那么这有一个例子 假设我的理由如下 好吧 我被告知  Jones was sentenced to nine years in the violin case 

现在 你也许会认为 对于任何人 我们的刑事审判制度可不会 sentence to spend time inside a violin case  因此 Jones的获刑是不公正的 本例中 极大可能是 sentence to nine years in the violin case这个短语 在前提1中的解读 与在前提2中的解读是不同的 在前提1中 当我说到 Jones, I'm told, was sentenced to nine years in the violin case 我并不是指 Jones被判在要在小提琴盒中度过时间 我是指 Jones被判在监狱服刑9年 

并且他认为 他获刑是由于特定的犯罪事件 这个即是我提到的小提琴事件 也许是一次持械抢劫中 一把昂贵的小提琴被偷了 并且Jones被指控对持械抢劫小提琴负责 因此需在监狱服刑9年 因此 当我说出类似前提1中的语句时 这才是我大概想表达的意思 但是前提2 将短语sentenced to nine years in the violin case 用另一种方式解读了 用另一种方式解读了 前提2是这么说的 Jones被判 在小提琴事件内 服刑9年 

好 现在 很明显前提1 当合理解读时 会是成立的 而前提2 同样如此 

但是 上述两个前提无法得到该结论的理由是 该结论是个谬误 因为前提1中 sentence to spend nine years in the violin case 对该短语的解读 与前提2中同样短语的解读 是不同的 因此上述两个前提 合起来并非意味着 对Jones的判刑是不公正的 或是 该刑罚是对刑事审判制度的践踏 这个短语在两个前提中所指不同 

这就是我们得到了一个谬论的原因 表面看来 这个论证也许是有效的 但事实上 这是个谬论 而非有效论证 

来看另一个例子下面再举另一个例子 假设我说 有人告诉Amelia Bedelia to dress the chicken for dinner 

你们中有人熟悉Amelia Bedelia故事的人已经知道了 这些儿童故事讲述了一位佣人 得到了一系列的指示 但却完全理解成别的意思了 那么 其中一条指示是 好好准备晚餐用的鸡肉 

很显然 给Amelia Bedelia下指示的那位女士 赋予了dress一词特殊的含义 比如说 一种准备晚餐用鸡肉的方法 

Amelia Bedelia听从了指示 并去找符合鸡身材的晚宴服 

结果是 她找不着够小的衣服 能正好配上一只鸡的衣服 又或许是 屋子里刚好没有 尺码合适的晚宴服 

因此Amelia Bedelia找不到能给鸡穿上的晚宴服 而你也许会从上述两个前提中得到结论 即Amelia Bedelia无法完成指示 因为她没有完成指示所需的资源 [声音] 不是这样的 

事实是 Amelia Bedelia误解了指示的内容 这条指示想表达一种含义 而Amelia Bedelia将其理解成了另一种 

那么 尽管这个论证表面上是有效的 它其实无效的 同样 这个论证中利用了dress这个短语的歧义 好好准备晚餐用的鸡肉 

对吧? 这个短语有两种可能的解读 给Amelia Belelia下指示的人 本意是对该短语的正确解读 但是Amelia Bedelia对该指示的理解 是基于对短语的另一种解读 是错误的解读 因此 对于Amelia Bedelia来说 她无法完成指示 不过这是因为她误解了指示的内容 她对这些指示的解读不是正确的解读 好 因此 这些例子就是关于歧义的定义 以及歧义如何导致谬论 在下一讲中 我们还会讨论歧义的其他几种类型 每一种我们都会举几个例子 我们下次见。 

### Semantic and Syntactic Ambiguity

Today I want to talk about two different kinds of ambiguity and I want to explain how each of these different kinds of ambiguity can give rise to fallacies. I call them semantic and syntactic ambiguity. So what are these two different kinds of ambiguity? Let's look at some examples. 

So here are examples,of semantic ambiguity. Semantic ambiguity, is when a particular word has two different interpretations. The two different interpretations are two different interpretations, of that one word. So one example is, consider the newspaper headline, Gandhi stoned in rally in India. 

Well, there are two different interpretations of the verb stoned. Right? One interpretation is people threw stones at Gandhi at the rally in India. Another interpretation is, Gandhi was using illicit drugs at the rally in India. 

So those are two different interpretations of the word stoned, and they give rise to two different interpretations of what someone is saying when they say, Gandhi stoned in rally in India. 

Consider the sentence, Iraqi head seeks arms. "Kay, that sentence actually has two words that are ambiguous. There's the word head, and there's the word arms. Head could be interpreted to mean a part of the body, like the head. 

or it could be understood to mean a part of the body politic, right? The head of the body politic, the Iraqi President or the, 

Head of State, or the Head of their Defense Department or their Military Department, but the head of some Organization. That's to say the leader of some organization. So the word head, could be interpreted to mean, the leader of some organization. It could also be understood to mean the head, the top of the body. 

Arms, well arms of course could be understood to mean arms. Right? These appendages or they could be understood to mean weapons. 

So that sentence has two words, each of which is semantically ambiguous. And then there's the sentence, Meredith is in a terrible state. 

Well, of course, you might mean, when you say Meredith is in a terrible state, you might mean she's in a terrible psychological state. If she's very depressed, she's very upset, she's very angry. Or you might mean that she's in a state, like, one of the United States, or one of the states of some other country, but she's in a state, which is a terrible state. 

We don't need to name those okay, so these are examples of sentences that contain Semantic ambiguities. Semantically ambiguous expressions. Let's see how some of these give rise to fallacies. So consider this argument. Premis one, Ghandi stoned in rally in India. Premise two, Drug users are not qualified to lead. Conclusion, Ghandi not qualified to lead. Okay. Now superficially that might look a valid argument. Right, Gandhi falls into a certain category, stoned in the rally in India. People who fall into that category, are not qualified to lead, so Gandhi's not qualified to lead. 

But here's the thing, that first premise, as I said just a moment ago, has two acceptable interpretations. It could be understood as meaning, people threw stones at Gandhi in the rally in India, or it could mean Gandhi was using illicit drugs at the rally in India. 

Now, if it means the second thing, then this argument is valid. Gandhi is not qualified to lead. At least, given the truth of the two premises. And, I'm not going to comment on the truth or falsehood of the second premise. But the most plausible interpretation of that first premise is not, that Gandhi was using illicit drugs at the rally in India, it's that people threw stones at Gandhi, at the rally in India. 

And so on that interpretation, just because people threw stones at Gandhi at the rally in India, that doesn't mean Gandhi was using drugs and so it doesn't mean that Gandhi falls into the category that, the second premise is talking about. And so on that interpretation of premise one, the argument is not valid, it's a fallacy. 

Okay, so there's an example, of how the semantic ambiguity of the expression stoned, can give rise to a fallacy. Right, an argument that superficially seems valid, but it seems that way superficially, only because we're assigning the wrong interpretation to the word stoned. 

Okay, here's another example of how semantic ambiguity can give rise to a fallacy. So consider this argument. Meredith is in a terrible state. 

Meredith is in Texas. And therefore Texas is a terrible state. 

Okay, now apart from the question of whether or not the conclusion is true, I'd like you to notice that, if the first premise is understood as it most plausibly is understood, as meaning that Meredith is in a terrible psychological state. Let's say she's depressed, or she's very anxious, or she's upset. If that's the correct way to understand the first premise, then the argument is a fallacy. Superficially, it might seem valid. Meredith is in a terrible state. Meredith is in Texas, so Texas must be a terrible state. Well superficially that might seem valid, but it seems that way only because we're relying on one interpretation of the phrase state, terrible state. 

The correct way to understand premise one, is on the other interpretation. The interpretation according to which a terrible state is a terrible psychological state, not a terrible political or geographical state. 

So when we say, Meredith is in a terrible state, we're just saying that she's in a terrible psychological state. So, from the fact that Meredith is in a terrible psychological state, and the fact that she's in Texas, we can't infer anything about, whether or not Texas, the state of Texas, is a terrible state. Nothing follows. Okay. So those are some examples of how semantic ambiguity gives rise to fallacies. Now I said there was another kind of ambiguity, syntactic ambiguity. So what's that, and how does it give rise to fallacies? 

Syntactic ambiguity, is when you have a phrase, That can be given two different interpretations where the two different interpretations differ in the grammar, in what grammatical categories are assigned, to different parts of that phrase. 

So let me give you some examples to illustrate the idea. Consider the sentence, the government asks us to save soap and waste paper. 

Right, clearly there are two different interpretations of that sentence. It might be saying that the government asks us to save two things, soap and wastepaper. Or it might be understood as saying the government is asking us to do two things. First to save soap and secondly, to waste paper. 

Those are two different interpretations and they differ, not in the meaning of any particular word. They differ in how you're suppose to understand the nature of the government's request. Is the government asking us to do two things? One involving saving and one involving wasting, or is the government asking us to do one thing involving saving, but saving two different kinds of things, soap and waste paper. 

So, that's an example of syntactic ambiguity. Here's another example, Tuna biting off Washington coast. 

Again, there are two different ways to interpret this sentence. You can interpret it perhaps most plausibly as saying, to fishermen, look, if you're interested in fishing for tuna, you should fish off the Washington coast because if you fish off the Washington coast, you'll find that the tuna there are biting. Right, so you'll be able to catch tuna, if you fish off the Washington Coast. 

Another interpretation of that same sentence, somewhat less plausible, is to say that the tuna are biting off the Washington Coast. The Washington Coast is itself disappearing, as the tuna bite it off. 

Right? And those two different interpretations differ, according to whether biting is understood as a verb or biting off, is understood as a verb phrase, that relates tuna to the Washington coast. 

Okay. 

Finally consider this example, Police can't stop gambling. 

Okay, there are two different ways of understanding this sentence. Again, two different correct interpretations, two different possible interpretations. One is a saying that, there's gambling taking place and the police just can't stop it. No matter what the police do, the gambling will continue to take place. Because the gamblers are gambling in hidden places, where the police can't find them. Or the gamblers are gambling in places, where the police don't have a warrant to search. But the gambling is going on and the police just can't do anything to stop it. Or the sentence can be understood as saying, the police themselves are gambling and they just can't stop, no matter how hard they try. They can't stop themselves from gambling, okay? 

Two different interpretations of the sentence police can't stop gambling. Now notice how these examples of syntactic ambiguity can give rise to fallacies. 

Let's consider some examples. So, consider the following argument, police can't stop gambling, well anyone who can't stop gambling needs therapy. Therefore the police need therapy. 

Now Superficially this argument might look valid. It might seem to be saying, the police fall into this category of people who can't stop gambling and anyone who falls into that category needs therapy. So the police need therapy. 

But that's relying on one interpretation of the sentence, the police can't stop gambling, and that is not the interpretation that's probably correct, the interpretation that is probably correct is that, gambling is going on and the police cannot do anything to stop it from going on. 

And that is the correct interpretation of premise one, then the argument is invalid, the argument is a fallacy. Right? That fact, that the police can't stop gambling from going on and that anyone who can't stop themselves from gambling, needs therapy. From those 2 premises, that doesn't support the conclusion that the police need therapy. Right? It might support the conclusion that the inveterate gamblers that the police can't stop from gambling need therapy. But it doesn't support the conclusion that the police need therapy. So that's an example of how the syntactic ambiguity in the sentence, police can't stop gambling, can give rise to a fallacy. Here's another example, consider Premise one. The government asks us to save soap and waste paper Premise two, it's wrong to waste recyclable resources like paper. So conclusion, the government's request is unreasonable. 

Okay now superficially, again, this argument might appear to be valid because it might appear that well, the government is Asking us to do a couple of different things. And it's wrong to do one of those 2 things. So the government's request is unreasonable. But that interpretation of premise one, according to which the government is asking us to do a couple of different things, saving soap and wasting paper. 

That's not the most likely itnerpretation of that premise. The most likely interpration of that premise is an interpretation according to which it's saying that the government is asking us to do one thing to save, but it's asking us to save a couple different things, soap and waste paper. And then, from the fact that the government is asking us to save waste paper and that it's wrong to waste recyclable resources like paper, it doesn't follow at all, that the government's request is unreasonable and those two premises don't at all support the conclusion. 

And so given the most likely interpretation of premise one, this is a fallacy. This is a bad argument. It's a bad argument, but superficially it might seem like a good argument, again because of the syntactic ambiguity in the phrase, save soap and waste paper. 

Okay, so those are some examples to illustrate, how semantic ambiguity and syntactic ambiguity, can each give rise to fallacies. 

今天我想要讨论两种不同类型的歧义 并解释每种歧义如何 导出谬论 我称它们为语义歧义和句法歧义 这两种歧义到底是什么样的呢 也就是说运行速度更快 

这是关于语义歧义的例子 语义歧义就是 某个词语会产生两种解读 这两种解读 就是那个词语的两种释义 第一个例子是 想想报纸头条 印度群众向甘地投掷石块 

这里的动词 stone 可以有两种解读 对吧? 一种解读是 印度人民在集会时朝甘地丢石块 另一种解读是 甘地在印度集会上吸食违禁毒品 

所以这里的 stoned 有两个不同释义 它们会产生两种不同的解读 针对某些人说的 印度群众向甘地投掷石块 

再想想这句话 伊拉克首长请求武装 “凯 这句话其实有两个有歧义的词 一个是 head 另一个是 arm head 可以被解读为身体的一部分 就是头部 

或者它也可以被理解为一个国家的一部分 对吧 就是国家的首长 伊拉克总统 

或是政府首脑 或是国防部部长 或是他们的军事部部长 总之是某个组织的首脑 也就是 某些组织的领导 所以 head 这个词也可以被解释为某些组织的领导 它同样也可以被理解为头部 身体的顶部 

arms 当然可以被理解为手臂 对吧? 它们是身体的附件 或者也可以被解释为武器 

所以这句话有两个词含有语义歧义 接着看一句话 迈瑞迪斯状态不好 

当然 你可能是指 她的心理状态很糟糕 假设她很沮丧 难过 生气 或者你可能是指她在某个州 比如美国的某个州 或其他国家的州 但她所在的州 是一个非常糟糕的州 

我们不必指名道姓是哪些 这就是包含了语义歧义的例句 语义上有歧义的表达 我们来看看它们是如何导出谬误的 请看这个论证 前提一 甘地在印度集会上吸毒 前提二 瘾君子没有资格当领导 结论 甘地没有资格当领导 现在它表面上看似是一个有效论证 对 甘地被归入某个范畴 在印度集会上吸毒 被归入这个范畴的人 没有资格当领导 所以甘地没有资格当领导 

但是有个问题 前提一 就像我先前说的 有两种可能的解读 它也可以被理解为 印度人民在集会上朝甘地丢石块 或可以理解为甘地在印度集会上吸食违禁毒品 

现在 如果它是第二种解释 那么这个论证就是有效的 甘地就没有资格当领导 至少依据这两个前提来看是如此 我并不会评论前提二的真伪 但前提一看上去最可信的解释 并不是甘地在印度集会上吸食违禁毒品 而是 印度人民在集会上朝甘地丢石块 

因此 基于这个解释 仅仅因为印度人民在集会上朝甘地扔石块 并不意味着 甘地在吸毒 所以它不是指甘地被归入 前提二所指的那个范畴 所以基于前提一的这种解释 这个论证就是无效的 它是一个谬论 

好 这个例子告诉我们 stoned 这个词的语义歧义 是如何导出一个谬论的 它是一个表面上看似有效的论证 但它之所以如此 仅仅因为我们 对 stoned 这个词进行了错误的解读 

好了 接下来看另一个 关于语义歧义如何导出谬论的例子 想想这个论证 迈瑞迪斯在一个糟糕的州 

迈瑞迪斯在德克萨斯 所以德克萨斯是一个糟糕的州 

好了 现在暂且不论这个结论是否正确 是否正确 我希望你能注意到 假如前提一被解释为表面上最可信的意思 就是迈瑞迪斯处于一个糟糕的心理状态 我们假设她很沮丧 焦虑 或难过 如果这是前提一的正确理解方式 那么这个论证就是个谬论 表面上它看似有效 迈瑞迪斯在一个糟糕的州 迈瑞迪斯在德克萨斯 所以德克萨斯一定是个糟糕的州 表面上看上去是有效的 但会这样仅仅是因为 我们依赖于 state 或 terrible state 的其中一种解释 

前提一的正确理解方式正是运用另一种解释 根据该解释一个可怕的状态是一个 可怕的心理状态 而不是一个可怕的政治或地理的状态 

所以当我们说 梅雷迪思处于一个可怕的状态 我们只是说 她处于一个糟糕的心理状态之中 因此 从迈瑞迪斯处于一个可怕的心理状态的事实 和她位于得克萨斯州的事实 我们不能推断出 处于或不处于 得克萨斯州 是一个可怕的状态 无法得出任何结论 好 所以这些都是一些由语言歧义导致谬误的例子 此外还有一种歧义 句法歧义 那么 它是什么 又是如何导致谬误的？ 

句法歧义 是当你可以对一个短语 给出两种不同的解释 这两种解释拥有不同的语法格式 短语的不同部分 对应不同的语法范畴 

让我用例子来说得清楚些 考虑这一句 政府要求我们节约肥皂和废弃纸张 

显然对于这句话有两种截然不同的解释 既可能是说政府要求 我们节约两样东西 肥皂和废纸 也可能是说政府要求我们做两件事 第一件事 是节约肥皂 第二件事 是浪费纸张 

这就两种不同的解释 区别不在于 每一个单独的词的意思 而在于你怎样被预期去 理解政府要求的本质 政府是要求我们做两件事吗？ 一件是节约 一件是浪费 还是政府要求 我们做一件节约的事 节约两件物品 肥皂和废纸 

这就是句法歧义 另一个例子是 金枪鱼咬(掉)华盛顿海岸 

这一句又有两种解释的方式 最说得通的解释是 渔民们 瞧 如果你热衷捕金枪鱼 你应当来华盛顿海岸因为 如果你在华盛顿海岸捕鱼 你就会发现 许多金枪鱼在咬呢 这样 你就能捕到金枪鱼如果你来华盛顿海岸捕鱼的话 

该句的另一个说不大通的解释是 金枪鱼在咬华盛顿海岸 金枪鱼继续咬 华盛顿海岸就会慢慢消失 

对吧? 这两种解释的区别在于 咬被理解为动词 还是咬掉被理解为动词词组 它连接着金枪鱼和华盛顿海岸 

好 

最后思考这个例子 警察不能停止赌博 

存在两种对于该句的理解方式 又来了 两种完全不同但语法正确的解释 两种均有可能的解释 一个在说 发生了一场赌博 而警察没法阻止 无论警察怎样做 赌博都会继续发生 因为赌徒在一个隐秘的地方赌博 警察无法找到他们 或者赌徒在警察得不到搜查许可的地方 进行赌博 总之赌博仍在继续 警察做什么都没法阻止 或者该句还能这么理解 警察们自己 就在赌博 他们停不下来 无论用什么方法 他们就是戒不了赌 对吗？ 

警察不能停止赌博的两种解释 注意这些例子 其中的句法歧义是怎样导致谬误发生的 

我们再考虑一些例子 思考如下论证 警察不能停止 赌博 任何无法停止赌博的人需要治疗 因此警察需要治疗 

表面看来 这种说法也许有效 它似乎在说 警察落入了 不能停止赌博的人的范畴中 而任何落入这个范畴中的人都需要治疗 因此警察需要治疗 

但这依赖于对于警察无法停止赌博 这句话的一种解释 而这个解释未必正确 可能正确的解释是 赌博在持续 而警察对此无能为力 

这才是前提一的正确解释 所以论证无效 该论证是谬论 对吧? 警察无法停止赌博的事实 和任何无法停止赌博的人需要治疗的事实 由这2个前提 得不出 警察需要治疗的结论 对吧? 它也许能得出 嗜赌如命连警察都没法阻止的赌徒 需要治疗 这样的结论 但也得不出警察需要治疗的结论 这正是该句中的句法歧义 警察无法停止赌博 导致谬误的例子 还有一个例子 考虑前提一 政府要求我们节约肥皂和废弃纸张 前提二 浪费如纸张之类的可循环资源是不对的 结论 政府的要求是不合理的 

好吧 表面上看来 论断可能 是有效的 因为 似乎 政府的确要求我们做了不同的事 而做这两件事的其中一件是不对的 因此政府的要求是不合理的 但是有关前提一的解释 即政府要求我们做两件事 节约肥皂和浪费纸张 

不太可能是该前提的正确解释 该前提最可能的解释是 政府要求我们 只做一件事 去节约两样东西 肥皂和废纸 然后呢 由政府要求我们节约废纸的事实 和浪费可回收资源如纸张是错误的这一事实 得不出政府的要求 不合理 这两个前提完全推不出结论 

因此考虑到前提一最有可能的解释 论证就是谬论 这是一个糟糕的论证 一个糟糕的论证 虽然表面看来 像是个不错的论证 但因为 对于短语的句法歧义 节约肥皂和废弃纸张 

好的 这就是例子要阐明的 语言歧义和句法歧义 是怎样导致谬误的 

### Fallacies of Equivocation

In the last couple of lectures, we've been talking about the phenomena of ambiguity. Semantic ambiguity and syntactic ambiguity. And we've shown how these phenomena can give rise to fallacies. 

Well, the fallacies to which ambiguities give rise are what we'll call fallacies of equivocation. Today we're going to talk about fallacies of equivocation. 

So, what's a fallacy of equivocation? 

Well, here's how we define it. A fallacy of equivocation, is a fallacy that results when an argument appears to be valid, only because it switches between two different interpretations of an ambiguous expression. 

Alright, so, a fallacy of equivocation, since it's a fallacy, it can't be valid, but it appears to be valid, and it appears that way only because it switches between the two different interpretations. 

Okay, so we've already seen a bunch of examples. Today I just want to present a couple more examples of fallacies of equivocation. 

So here's one, consider this argument, six is an odd number of legs for a horse. Now that's, that's true, horses typically have four legs. 

Odd numbers cannot be divided by two. That's true also. That's just the definition of an odd number. Three, five, seven, nine, elevent, these are all odd numbers because they can't be divided by two. Therefore. The argument concludes, six cannot be divided by two. Okay. 

That's a fallacy. It might appear to be valid. 

Because, when you look at the first premise. And it says, six is an odd number of legs to, for a horse. You might think, oh. Well, that means six is an odd number. Right, because it's an odd number of legs for a horse, which means it's an odd number of legs, which means it's an odd number. And since odd numbers can't be divided by two, you might think, you can conclude that six cannot be divided by two. 

But of course that's wrong. 

that conclusion is false and it's not supported by the premises when properly understood. When the first premise says six is an odd number of legs for a horse, that doesn't imply six is an odd number. The correct interpretation of odd number as it occurs in the first premise is different from the correct interpretation of odd number as it occurs in the second premise. The phrase odd number can have a couple different interpretations. On one interpretation it means a number that's not divisible by two. On the other interpretation it means an unusual number. This argument appears to be valid, only because it switches between those two interpretations from premise one to premise two. Six is an unusual number of legs for a horse. And of course, odd numbers, numbers that are not divisible by two, of course, by definition, can't be divided by two. But it doesn't follow that six cannot be divided by two. Six is an odd number in the first sense of being an unusual number of legs for a horse, but it's not an odd number in the second sense. It's not an odd number in the sense that it is not divisible by two. 

So that's an example of the fallacy of equivocation. Here is another example. 

Man is the only rational animal. 

I believe it was Aristotle who said the ancient Greek equivalent of that. No woman is a man. That seems true. Therefore, no woman is a rational animal. 

Okay, now, superficially it might look like that argument is valid. But in fact that's a fallacy. That's not a valid argument. Why? Well, because the expression man, can be given two different interpretations, an this argument switches between those two different interpretations. Right, so, on one interpretation of man, it just means an adult male human. 

And on that interpretation, it's true that no woman is a man. Premise two is true, when the word man is understood that way, is given that interpretation as just adult male human. 

But sometimes the word man is used more generally. To mean human being. And when it's used that way, 

while premise one might be true, premise two certainly isn't true. It certainly isn't true that no woman is a human being. All women are human beings. 

So, while premise one might be true on that more general interpretation of the word man, premise two is not true on that more general interpretation of the word man. So the reason this argument is a fallacy is because there's no single interpretation of the word man on which premise one and premise two can possibly both be true. 

Right? There are two interpretations of the word man. On one of those interpretations, premise one might be true. On the other of those interpretations, premise two is true. But there's no interpretation on which both premise one and premise two could possibly be true. 

And, by the way, I should mention, for those who use the word man to mean something very general, like, human being, 

that they would then have to feel comfortable saying things like man nurses his young for up to two years, or man gestates his fetuses for nine months. 

I wonder. Anyhow, so those are examples of some fallacies of equivocation. 

Next week we'll be talking about, very different fallacies, fallacies of relevance. See you next week. 

在上几节课中 我们讨论了歧义 语义歧义和语法歧义 我们已经说明了这些现象是怎么产生谬误的了 

这些由于歧义产生的谬误 我们称之为多义谬误 今天我们将讨论这些多义谬误 

那么 什么是多义谬误呢? 

好吧 我们是这么定义的 多义谬误 是一种当论证仅是因为在一个歧义的 两种不同的解释中不断变换 才有效的时候产生的谬误 

好吧 多义谬误 既然是谬误 那它必然是无效的 但是 它看起来是有效的 而它之所以看起来这样 仅仅是因为它在两个不同的解释间不断变换 

好吧 我们已经看过很多例子了 今天我只想再给一些多义谬误的例子 

接下来就是一个 想想这个论证 马有6条腿是很奇的 这是对的 因为马正常只有4条腿 

奇数不能被2整除 这也是对的 这是奇数的定义本身 3 5 7 9 11 这些数 都是奇数 因为它们不可被2整除 所以所以 论证的结论是 6不能被2整除 好 

这是个谬误 也许它看起来有效 

因为当你考虑第一个前提时 它说 6作为一匹马的腿数 是很奇的 你也许会想 好吧 那就是说6是一个奇数 好吧 因为它是一个奇怪的数 对于马的腿数来说 所以它是一个奇数 又因为奇数不能被2整除 你也许会想 你可以得出结论 6不能被2整除 

但这明显错了 

结论是错的而且并不为前提所支持 如果正确理解前提的话 当第一个前提说对一匹马的腿数来说 6是一个奇（怪）数 这不意味6是一个奇数 第一个前提中奇数的正确理解是 不同于第二个前提中 奇数的正确理解的 奇数可以有几个不同的解释 一种是不被2整除的数 另一种是不寻常的数 这个论证貌似有效 仅仅因为它在 前提一和前提二的两种解释间变换而已 6是一个奇怪的马腿数 当然 奇数 那些不被2整除的数 从定义来说 不被2整除 但这不能得出6不被2整除 的结论 6是奇数在第一句中意味着6是一个不寻常的 马腿的数目 但并非第二句的奇数 并不是不被2整除的那种奇数 

这就是一个多义谬误的例子 这里还有另一个例子 

人是唯一的理性动物 

我记得是亚里士多德说的 当然用的是古希腊语 女人不是男人 看起来是真的 那么 女人不是理性的动物 

好吧 表面上论证看来是有效的 但是其实是个谬误 这不是有效的论证 为什么？ 因为 man这个词有两个意思 而论证在两种 不同的解释间变换 man的第一个解释 是成年雄性人类 

在这个意思下 女人不是man 在man是成年雄性人类的情况下  前提二是对的 

但有时候man用法更广泛一些 即意味着人类 当它这么用的时候 

也许前提一是对的 前提二绝对错了 女人不是人类肯定错了 所有的女人都是人类 

所以 当前提一 也许在更广泛的那个意思下是对的 前提二在那种意思下是错的 所以这个论证之所以是谬误 是因为没有单一的解释 能使前提一和前提二都是真的 

对吧? man有两种解释 在一种释义下 前提一也许是对的 在另一种释义下 前提二是对的 但没有令两个前提都可能 为真的释义 

顺带一提 我应该提到 对那些使用广义的词汇 比如人类的人来说 

他们应该必须适应这些说法 比如有（男）人用乳汁喂养了他的小孩两年 或者有（男）人为他十月怀胎 

呵呵 无论如何 这些就是多义谬误的例子 

下一周我们将讨论 大不相同的谬误 相关性谬误 下周见
