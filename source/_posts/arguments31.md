# Welcome to the Course

Welcome to Think Again: How to Reason Inductively! This course is the third in a series of four courses jointly titled Think Again: How to Reason and Argue. We are excited that you are taking this course, and we hope that you will take all four courses in the series, because there is a great deal of important material to learn.

In the series as a whole, you learn how to analyze and evaluate arguments and how to avoid common mistakes in reasoning. These important skills will be useful to you in deciding what to believe and what to do in all areas of your life.

The first part of this course introduces the series and the course. It also clarifies some peculiarities you may find with this course. We encourage you to watch the "Introduction to the Course" video first as it will help you learn more from the materials that come later.

## introduction

### introduction to the course

Hi, I'm Walter Sinnott-Armstrong from Duke University. 
And I'm Ram Neta from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
Three years ago, Ram and I constructed a Coursera course called, Think Again. It taught students how to analyze and evaluate arguments. >>It taught them how to tell the difference between good reasoning and bad reasoning. >>Over the last three years, we've had a wonderful time teaching Think Again. And really enjoyed interacting in the discussion forums with students from all over the world. >>We were extremely pleased with the reaction to our course. Over the past three years, over 750,000 students enrolled in that course. >>But, we realized that we could teach the course even more effectively if we made a few small changes. >>First, it wasn't easy to cover all the material that we wanted to cover in the 12 weeks of our course. Each week contained hours of lecture, exercises, and quizzes. And doing all those hours of work every week for 12 weeks was a tall order. >>In the third week of each section of that old course, we asked you to learn new material and then also take a quiz. Well, that's just too much. >>So for these reasons, we decided that the best way for students to learn all of the material that we wanted to teach them was to divide up our original course into four much shorter courses. >>That way you can take one of the courses, take off a month or two, take another course. Maybe skip a course, we hope you won't, but do it at your own pace and the way that fits your lifestyle best. And that way, you're most likely to end up learning all of the material that we want you to learn. Maybe not this year, but eventually. >>And the material really does fit together, so even though we've split up the course into four separate courses. It's very worthwhile for you to take all the different courses if you possibly can. >>The lectures and the mini course that you're about to take now, were all part of our original 12 week course. And so frequently, you're going to find that we make references in those lectures to other features of that original 12 week course. >>For example, very early on I say, that arguments have a form or a structure and that we'll study that form or structure in future weeks in the course. Well, now that's in the second course, the course on deductive logic. >>And I begin the course in deductive logic by saying, welcome to unit two of our course. Well, I was referring to unit two of our original 12 week course. But now, deductive logic is it's own course. And when I talk about weeks four and five, I'm referring to weeks four and five of our original 12 week course. But now, there weeks one and two of the deductive logic course. >>We hope this is not too confusing but the basic message is really simple. Just ignore all of those cross references to other parts of courses or other courses, just the same way you would ignore the wrinkles on an old road map. >>Hey, I like to use wrinkled road maps. >>Well, it's fine to use wrinkled road maps as long as you know the wrinkles aren't extra roads because then you are going to drive off onto them. >>So you're saying, that the students can learn all the material that we want to teach them even if they ignore all of our references to the old 12-week course? >>Exactly. >>Sounds like a plan to me. >>We hope that you enjoy taking this mini course just as much as we enjoyed making it. >>And we hope that it encourages you to take the other courses in our Think Again sequence. >>And also to encourage your friends and family to take this series of courses as well, because it's a lot more fun to take these courses together with other people, so that you can talk to them about the arguments you'll be studying. >>Thank you for listening. 

### course logistics

Welcome to Think Again: How to Reason Inductively! This course is the third in a series of four courses titled Think Again: How to Reason and Argue. We are excited that you are taking this course, and we hope that you will take all four courses in the series, because there is a great deal of important material to learn.

In the series as a whole, you learn how to analyze and evaluate arguments and how to avoid common mistakes in reasoning. These important skills will be useful to you in deciding what to believe and what to do in all areas of your life.

The third course in the series focuses on inductive arguments. We encounter inductive reasoning in murder mysteries and science as well as simply deciding whom to trust in everyday life. Car mechanics and computer repairers use inductive reasoning in deciding what caused a car or computer to fail. Meteorologists and sports gamblers use inductive reasoning in predicting weather and winners. Think Again: How to Reason Inductively will show how to analyze and evaluate a variety of inductive arguments in all of these areas and more.

This course will contain lectures, ungraded exercises, and one final quiz that will count towards the certificate, if you choose.

LECTURES: Each week will consist of a set of modules that will contain a series of short lectures along with practice quizzes. The topics are described in the syllabus on the course website and at the beginning of each week.

PRACTICE QUIZZES: The point of the practice quizzes is only to make sure that you understand the material in the corresponding lecture. They are not intended to be difficult. If you miss too many questions in the practice quizzes and if you do not understand the explanations of the answers that we provide, then it might be a good idea to listen again to the relevant lecture before proceeding to the next lecture. All of these practice quizzes are ungraded and optional, but we hope that they will help you learn more. If you have trouble with any question in the practice quizzes, then you should post your questions on the discussion forums. If you do not have trouble, please go into the discussion forums and help your fellow students with their questions. The best way to learn is to teach. In the previous runs of this course, many students were extremely good at helping other students. We and our teaching assistants will also check the forums occasionally in order to provide additional assistance.

FINAL QUIZ: The final quiz at the end of the course will contain questions similar to the practice quizzes. You may take the quiz as many times as you want in order to pass, with different questions each time. You will be able to retake the quiz three times every eight hours. We will provide explanations of all of the answers in each quiz so that you can check those explanations before trying the quiz again.

TEXTBOOK: We suggest that you obtain and read the recommended textbook: Understanding Arguments, Ninth Edition, Concise Version, by Walter Sinnott-Armstrong and Robert Fogelin. Chapters 8-12 are relevant to this first course. This textbook is not required in order to do well in this course or the other courses in this series, but it will probably help you by providing more examples, exercises, and explanations. You can buy a paperback or electronic copy here, if you like:

Link to buy Understanding Arguments, Ninth Edition, Concise Version

WORKLOAD: For each module, you should expect to spend on average roughly 2 hours watching the lectures, another 2 hours doing the exercises, another hour per week reading the textbook (which is optional), and about 1 hour each time you take the quiz. Some students spend more time, and some spend less. The more time you spend, the more you will learn.

FORUMS: The best way to learn about arguments is to practice constructing your own arguments and analyzing arguments given by other people, especially people with whom you disagree. We provide opportunities for such exchanges in the discussion forums, which are also places to find answers to your questions, new examples, and stimulating discussions of various issues with fellow students from around the world.

Special Discussion Forums can also be used to set up study groups, give feedback on course material, seek help with technical difficulties, and tell us and other students about yourself. Please be polite when using these forums. You will be able to vote up or down posts in these forums so that the most useful posts will rise to the top and be seen first.

EMAIL POLICY: Please do NOT email the professors. Unfortunately, it will not be possible for us respond. We wish we could, but there are simply too many students for us to be able to reply to individual emails. Thanks for understanding.

SPREAD THE WORD: You will get more out of this course if you share the adventure, so we suggest that you encourage your friends, relatives, neighbors, or colleagues to take the course with you.

We hope that you are looking forward to the course. We are.

Let’s get going!

# Inductive Arguments

CONTENT: This week begins by distinguishing inductive arguments from deductive arguments. Then we discuss four common forms of inductive argument: generalizations from samples (such as in political polls), applications of generalizations to particular cases (such as in predicting weather on a certain day), inferences to the best explanation (such as in using evidence to determine who committed a crime), and arguments from analogy (such as in identifying the use of one archaeological artifact by comparing it to other artifacts). We will expose the most common mistakes in these kinds of reasoning. Some of the "lectures" this week are a bit experimental (and perhaps weird!), as you will see. We hope that you enjoy them.

LEARNING OUTCOMES: By the end of this week's material you will be able to do:

distinguish inductive from deductive arguments
classify inductive arguments into five kinds
identify and evaluate arguments that generalize from samples
identify and evaluate arguments that apply generalizations to cases
identify and evaluate inferences to the best explanation by applying standards that good explanations must meet
identify and evaluate arguments from analogy
OPTIONAL READING: If you want more examples or more detailed discussions of these kinds of inductive arguments, we recommend Understanding Arguments, Ninth Edition, Chapters 8 and 9.

## A New Way to Argue

### what is induction

[BLANK_AUDIO] . Well, welcome back. I've really missed you over the last couple of weeks, when you've been off with [INAUDIBLE] learning about propositional logic, and then categorical logic. 

And I hope that you enjoyed that. It's very important. But in the next few weeks, we're going to turn to a different kind of argument. Because, that type of logic is appropriate for deductive arguments, but what we're going to study instead is inductive arguments. Now deductive arguments are given quite often, throughout life. But inductive arguments are probably even more common. 

Whenever you want to figure out who committed a crime. We're talking about an inference to the best explanation. 

Then there are arguments from analogy, which happen quite often. Just think about all the analogies that you run into in life. And then we'll see statistical generalizations. Well, just think about all the polls in politics these days. And statistical applications. Whenever you want to know how those generalizations tell you something about a particular person. And then we'll turn to causal reasoning. Well, causes are crucial to everything, from science to figuring out what made your car stop. 

And, decision making and probability. So, we got a lot of things to cover. And the first thing that we need to do, is to see the difference between inductive and deductive arguments. Because you've been focused for a couple of weeks with Ron about deductive arguments. And you need to understand what's the difference between those arguments, and the ones that we're going to study over the next couple of weeks. 

In order to see that difference, I'm going to show you a little video. It's a video I made a few years ago, so you might notice that I was a little younger back then. Okay, fair enough. But, I think this video will help you see. What the difference is between inductive arguments and deductive arguments. 

Rainy days and Mondays always get me down. >>The sun will come out tomorrow, bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow there'll be sun, tomorrow, tomorrow. 

Wait a minute, wait a minute. How do you know that? >>I heard a weather report. >>So what. They get it wrong all the time. >>Well, maybe the sun won't come out tomorrow. But it will come up tomorrow. >>So you say. But is that really true? 

How many of you agree that the sun'll come up tomorrow morning? >>Of course. >>Definitely. >>Absolutely yes. >>Everybody knows that. >>Okay. So you all agree with her. But do you really know that it's true? How could you show that the sun will come up tomorrow? 

I don't know I'm just kid. >>Wait, I didn't, I didn't mean to get you all upset. 

But there really is an issue here. The question is, how can you prove that the sun will come up tomorrow morning? Well here's one way that people use. The conclusion is that the sun will come up tomorrow. 

The premise is, yesterday the sun came up. The second premise, the day before that the sun came up. The third premise the day before that the sun came up. Then the day before that, the day before that, the day before that, the day before that, the day before that, the day before that Well that can get awfully long so we'll shorten the argument. The conclusion is still that the sun will come up tomorrow. But the premises are just the sun came up yesterday, and the sun came up every day before that for an awfully long time. Now, is the argument valid, yes or no? 

Right. It's not valid. 

An argument is valid if and only if it's not possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. But it is possible for these premises to be true. And this conclusion to be false. Can you imagine how that would happen. One way, would be if a meteor struck the Earth in the middle of the night, and stopped it from spinning. Then the sun wouldn't rise tomorrow. [MUSIC] >>Now you're really freaking me out. >>But don't worry, that's extremely unlikely. However, it's possible. And that shows that the argument is not valid. 

The next question is, is this argument any good? 

An argument's good if it serves its purpose. The purpose of this argument, and many other arguments, is to provide reasons for its conclusion. So, do the premises in this argument provide reasons for its conclusion? 

Yes, some philosophers deny this, but most people think that these premises provide good reasons for its conclusion. So let's assume that for now. 

What does that show? That shows that some arguments can be good, even if they're not valid. But don't generalize too quickly. There are other arguments that are no good because they're invalid. Take bug for example. 

Is it true that every sophomore is a student. >>Yeah. >>Are you a sophomore? >>No. >>So you are a student, right? 

Wrong, I am a student. >>Well then what's wrong with the argument. Every sophomore is a student. You're not a sophomore, so you're not a student. >>Well both the premises are true, but the conclusion's false so the argument must be invalid. >>So you're telling me what makes that argument bad is that it's invalid. >>Yep. >>Good job. 

Now we've got a puzzle. Some arguments are bad, because they're invalid. Whereas other arguments are good even though they're invalid. How can that be? Simple. There're two kinds of arguments, deductive and inductive. Deductive arguments are bad when they're invalid. Inductive arguments can be good, even though they are invalid, why? Because deductive arguments are intended to be valid, where as inductive arguments are not intended to be valid. The crucial point is that there are different kinds of standards for evaluating arguments. 

Deductive standards ask whether an argument is valid or invalid. Inductive standards ask whether an argument is strong or weak. 

There're several important differences between these standards. First, deductive validity is all or nothing. 

An argument is either valid or not. It can't be partly valid or a little valid, any more than a woman can be a little pregnant. 

Inductive strength and contrast comes in degrees. 

An argument is stronger when it gives more, and better reasons for it's conclusion. So an argument can be very weak, when the reasons it gives for its conclusion are very weak or can be moderately strong when it gives moderately strong reasons for its conclusion. Or can be very strong when it gives very strong reasons for its conclusion. Since inductive strength comes in degrees, we can't simply ask whether an argument is strong. We need to ask whether it is strong enough. That depends on the context and the values at stake. Psyched about your cooking lesson? >>Yeah! >>One of the most important things in cooking is to make sure that whatever it is you're cooking is done. 

When people cook cakes. The way they normally test it for being done, is they take a straw or a piece of bamboo and they stick it in the middle of the cake. If it comes up with raw dough it's not done. But if it comes up clean like this that means it's done. 

Well, at least in that spot, but you want to make sure that it's done. Throughout the whole cake, then you have to test other spots as well. 

Whoa! What are you doing? >>

So much for that. Now, when you're cooking turkey, you could use the same method. You could stick in a straw or a piece of bamboo, and see whether any pink juice comes out. If it comes out pink, then it's not done. But if out comes out clean, then the turkey's done. 

See any pink juice? >>Nope. >>Then it must be done. Let's try a 

piece. 

There. 

But you wouldn't want to do that with turkey, because you can get very sick from uncooked turkey. That's why. Most of the time they build a pop-up meat thermometer right into the turkey, to make sure that nobody eats uncooked turkey. >>[SOUND] >>But this is not a cooking class. 

The point here is simply that, whether an argument is strong enough depends on what's at stake. When there's a lot to lose, we demand better reasons and stronger arguments. 

Context is also important in another way. Additional information from the context can weaken an inductive argument. That is, it can change it from strong to weak. In technical language, the inductive standard of strength is called defeasible. Or, non-monotonic. In contrast, the deductive standard of validity is indefeasible, or monotonic. That means, no matter what premises you add to a valid argument, it will still be valid. Go ahead, try. Here's an example. If Joe is a sophomore, then Joe is a student. Joe is not a student, so Joe is not a sophomore. 

Add any premise you want to that argument, and it will still be valid. Which shows that the deductive standard of validity is indefeasible. In contrast, the inductive standard of strength. Is defeasible. If you add additional premises or additional information it can make a strong argument weak. 

Consider a courtroom. >>I'm sure it was him. 

He was only ten feet away from me, I saw him do it. >>I'm sure it was him, I saw him with my own eyes. >>Yes. >>I'd like to cross examine this witness. Are you positive that it was the defendant sitting right there? Or could it have been his identical twin brother, who is entering the court room right now? >>

It could have been. I can't tell them apart. >>Now I would like to recall the first witness. And let me remind you that you're still under oath. 

Can you tell the difference between those two gentlemen? >>No, they look like the same person to me. >>

Now there's a reasonable doubt, isn't there? What was very strong evidence, becomes much weaker when we add the new evidence about the identical twin. That is an example of the defeasibility of inductive standards. Although tricky, it's important to classify arguments as inductive or deductive, because it affects whether they're good or bad. 

An inductive argument might not be valid, but it can still be good. For example, the sun came up yesterday. It came up every day for thousands of years. Therefore, it will come up tomorrow. 

That's a good argument, even though it's invalid, because it's not intended to be valid. 

This is just one instance of a general rule that you shouldn't criticize something for not being what it's not suppose to be. This book can be a good book, even though, it's no good as a frisbee. 

Similarly an argument can be a good argument. Even if it's not valid, it's not intended to be valid. That is, if it's an inductive argument. 

This point undermines many common mistakes about inductive arguments. Many people think that inductive arguments are somehow inferior to deductive arguments because they're not valid. But that can't be right, because it's easy to take any inductive argument and turn it into a deductive argument. For example, most of Joe's friends are seniors, so Joe must be a senior too. 

Well, we can make that argument valid simply by adding a conditional premise. If most of Joe's friends are seniors then Joe is a senior too. 

But that just shifts all the doubts about the inductive argument. Into doubts about the conditional premise. So it hasn't really made us more sure of whether Joe is a senior. Our definition of induction also undermines a second common mistake. Many people believe that induction always takes us from the particular to the general. But no matter how many people say that, it's just plain wrong. Inductive generalization is one kind of inductive argument. But it's not the only kind. In fact, we are going to study five different types of inductive arguments. 

To see the differences between these arguments. Let's do a simple experiment. 

Excuse me, we're testing a new type of lemonade here. Would you help us out? >>Sure. >>Thank you. first, could you try one from that cup? >>That's pretty good. >>Great. Glad to hear it. Now, could you try the second cup please? 

Oh, that's terrible. >>Your reaction suggests that you don't like that. >>Well, obviously you put dish washing liquid in there. >>How do you know that? >>Well, it tastes like soap. >>Is that why you spit it out? >>Well, I didn't spit out the first one did I? >>You might be interested to know you agree with over 90% of the people we tested so far. They all like our lemonade better than dish washing liquid. >>That's great. >>And if you take it back to your dorm and try this test on your dorm, I bet they'll like our lemonade too. >>Well of course they would. Listen this is stupid, I'm out of here. >>This experiment would be stupid, if it were intended to show something about lemonade. But all it's supposed to show is the differences among the different kinds of inductive arguments. 

Our next step will be to look at each of these kinds of induction in more detail. 

[空白] 欢迎回来 在刚刚过去的几周里我非常想念大家 假设对健康食品很偏执的 格雷格·曼德尔(Greg Mandela)［无声］ 我们之前已经学过命题逻辑 以及范畴逻辑 

希望大家学的开心 这是非常重要的这非常重要 在接下来的几周里 我们将要学习一种完全不同的论证方法 因为 接下来我们要学习的这种逻辑方法并非演绎论证的一种 而是归纳论证中的一部分 在我们的生活中 经常能够遇到 演绎论证 但其实归纳式论证更为常见 

当你想要找出犯罪者是谁的时候 我们要找到的就是在最优解释下所能得到的推论 

下面是是类推法的几个常见例子 想一下你在生活中遇到的所有的类推问题 你会发现他们都是统计概括的问题 想一下 政治中的民意测试 依然是统计学的应用问题 当你想知道关于某个人的 一些概括性描述的时候 我们要用到因果推理 原因对于所有的事物来说都是很重要的 从科学研究到弄明白是什么停下了你的车 

然后做出决策并预测可能的结果 所以 我们接下来要做 很多项内容 首先 我们要做的第一件事 是来比较一下归纳论证与演绎论证的不同之处 因为大家已经和 Ron 一起上了好几周 关于演绎论证的课程了 你需要搞清楚的就是之前学习的这些论证 与我们在之后几周里学习的这些有何区别 

为了让大家能够看出其中的差异 我要为大家放一部短片 这是 我几年前制作的一部短片 所以你会看到里面的我比现在要年轻 好了 短片放完了 我觉得 这个片子能够帮助你了解 归纳论证和演绎论证之间的差别 

下雨天和星期一经常会使我们心情低落 -明天会放晴的 我打赌 明天一定会放晴的 明天 

-等一下 等一下 你怎么会知道呢 -因为我收听了天气预报 -那又怎样 它们总是出错 -好吧 或许明天不会放晴 但明天太阳还是会出来 -所以你要这么说 但这个就真实了吗 

你们中有多少人同意 明天早上太阳会升起？ -当然了 -这还用说么 -当然同意了 -这是每个人都知道的 — 好的 所以 你同意她所说的话 不过你真的确定它是对的吗 你怎么证明明天太阳会升起来 

-我不知道 我还是个小孩子 -等一下 我这么问并不是为了让大家苦恼 

而是这里真的存在一个问题： 你怎么能够证明太阳明天会升起来？ 这有一个人们常用的方法 结论是太阳明天会升起来 

前提是 昨天太阳升起来了 另一个前提是 前天太阳升起来了 第三个前提是 大前天太阳也升起来了 然后前天的前天 前天的前天的前天 前天的前天的前天的前天 一直往前推到足够远 这是一个非常长的论证 让我们来简化一下这个论证 结论仍然是明天太阳会升起 不过前提变成了 太阳昨天升起来了 太阳在之前相当长的日子里 都升起来了 现在这个论证就成立了 是吗？ 

当然 它依旧是无效的 

当且仅当 前提正确则结论不可能不为真时 一个结论才成立 对于这个例子来说 前提可能是对的 但是结论却不为真 你可以设想一下这是怎样一种情形 比如说 一颗陨石与地球相撞了 在午夜的时候 地球停止了自转 那太阳明天就不会升起来了 [背景音乐] 翻译: RyukaSuu |审阅: 19waa Coursera Global Translator Community -现在你可吓到我了 -但是不要担心 发生这件事的可能性几近于零 但 仍然不能否认它存在的可能 这就可以证明这个论证是无效的 

下面一个问题是 这个论证是好的吗？ 

一个好的论证在于它能为它的目标服务 这个论证的目标 以及很多其他论证的目标都在于 为它的结论提供原因支持 那么 这个论证中的前提为它的结论提供原因支持了吗？ 

当然 有些哲学家会持否定意见 但是大多数人会觉得刚才所说的 前提为它的结论提供了很好的原因支持 所以让我们来做一个假设 

这说明了什么呢 这说明一些论证即使是无效的 但也可能是好的 只是它们归纳的速度很慢 这里还有一些 因为无效而不好的论证 我们来举一个错例 

-每一个二年级生都是学生 这是对的吗 — 是的 -你是二年级生吗 -不是 -所以你（不）是一个学生 对吗？ 

-不 我是一个学生 -那么这个论证就有问题 每一个二年级生都是学生 你不是一个二年级生 所以你不是一个学生 两个前提都是正确的 但是 结论是错误的 所以这个论证是无效的 -所以 你是在告诉我 是因为论证的无效而使它成为一个不好的论证 -是的 做的好 

现在我们有一个疑问 一些论证因无效不好 与此同时 一些论证即使无效也是好的 这是怎么一回事？ 其实很简单 这里有两种论证 演绎论证和归纳论证 对于演绎论证来说 当它们无效时就是坏的 但对于归纳论证来说 它们却仍可能是好的 这是为什么呢？ 因为演绎论证的目的在于有效 而归纳论证则没有这一目的 重点在于 对于不同的论证有不同的评价标准 

演绎论证的标准在于它是否有效 归纳论证的标准在于它的结论是否有力 

不同的标准之间有几个重要的差别 第一 演绎推理的有效性 不是全部 就是完全没有 

一个论证不是有效就是无效 不可能是部分有效或者是有点效果 一个妇女不可能是有点怀孕 

而归纳论证的有力程度则分等级 

当一个论证能说明更多东西 并能给它的结论更多支撑时 它就更有力 当一个论证对于结论的支撑很弱时 它就是非常弱的 当它能给予结论有力的支撑时 它就是非常有力的 由于归纳法的力度是分等级的 所以我们并不能简单的说一个论证是否有力 我们需要问的是它是否足够有力 这要依据上下文以及危险程度而定 要上烹饪课了　是不是很兴奋呀？ — 耶! 烹饪最重要的一点是 不管你做什么菜都要确保菜熟了 

比如做蛋糕的时候 通常测试蛋糕是否做好的方法是拿一根吸管 或者一小段竹管　将它插入到蛋糕中间 （吸管）拔出来后　若沾着生面团　则蛋糕没好 若像这样干净　则蛋糕做好了 

至少在蛋糕的那一小块上　你可以确定是否做好了 对于整个蛋糕来说　还需要测试其他部分 

哇！你在做什么？ — 

就这些 烤火鸡的时候　可以采取同样的方法 可以将一根吸管或者一小段竹管插入火鸡中 观察是否有粉红色的汁流出来 如果有　表明火鸡还没有好 若没有　表明火鸡已经熟了 

-有看到粉红色的汁流出来吗？ -没有 -那火鸡一定熟了　 

尝一小块 

在这 

但是你不会想尝一下那只火鸡 因为吃未煮熟的火鸡会得病的 这也是为什么 有时候　会在火鸡中放置一个弹出式温度计 确保不会有人吃到生火鸡 — [声音] 这不是一个烹饪班 

这里要说明的观点非常简单　 论证是否足够强取决于什么是最重要的 当要付出很多代价时　我们需要更好的理由和更强的论证 

上下文也很重要　上下文中额外的信息 可以削弱归纳论证　把它从强 变成弱　用术语来说　 归纳论证的力度标准是可废除的　或者说非单调的 相反　归纳论证的有效性标准是不可废除的　或者说单调的 这说明　不论增加什么前提 有效论证始终有效 来吧　试一下 举个例子　如果乔 是个大二学生　那么乔是个学生 如果乔不是学生　那么乔不是大二学生 

给这个论证添加任何前提　它始终有效 这表明归纳论证的有效性标准是不废除的 相反　归纳论证的力度标准 是可废除的 如果添加额外的前提或者额外的 信息会使得一个强论证变弱 

比如在法庭上 我确信一定是他 

他当时离我只有十英尺　我看见他做的事了 我确信一定是他　我亲眼看见的 没错 -我想交叉诘问这个证人 你确定当时是被告坐在那里？ 可不可能是被告同卵的双胞胎兄弟呢？ 他正进入法庭呢 — 

-有可能是　我无法分辨他们 =现在我想召回第一个证人 让我提醒你　你发过誓言的 

你可以搞清这两位男士之间的不同吗？ -不能　他们看起来一模一样 — 

-现在就存在一个合理的疑问　是吗？ 一个原本很强的证据变得很弱　因为 我们增加了关于双胞胎的新信息 这就是归纳标准的可废除性的一个例子 虽然棘手　但是将论证分为归纳论证或演绎论证是很重要的 因为这关系到它们是好还是坏 

一个归纳论证可能不是有效的　但它仍旧是好的 举个例子　昨天太阳升起了 在过去的几千年里　太阳每天都升起 因此　它明天也会升起 

这是一个好的论证　即使它不是有效的 因为它并不试图是有效的 

这只是一个一般规则的实例 （这个规范是）不该因为某物没有成为预料之外的事物而指责它 这本书是本好书 尽管它不像一个飞盘那么好 

同样的　一个论证可以是好论证 即使它是无效的　因为它的预估就是无效的 就是说　如果这是一个归纳论证 

这一点打破了许多关于归纳论证的常见错误 许多人认为归纳论证不如 演绎论证　因为它们是无效的 但是这样不对　因为可以轻易地把 一个归纳论证转化成演绎论证 举个例子　乔大部分的朋友都是老年人　那么乔也一定是个老年人 

只要增加一个条件性前提　就可以把这个论证变成有效的 如果乔大部分的朋友都是老年人　那么乔也是老年人 

但是这只是把关于 归纳论证的怀疑转移到条件性前提上 所以它并没有让我们更加确定乔是老年人 我们关于归纳的定义打破了第二个常见的错误 许多人认为归纳假设都是 从特殊到一般 但是不管多少人这么认为　它还是错的 归纳概括是归纳论证的一种 但它不是唯一一种 事实上　我们将学到五种不同类型的归纳论证 

为了比较这些论证的不同 来做一个简单的实验 

打扰一下　我们正在测试一种新的柠檬水 你能帮助我们吗？ — 是的 没错 谢谢 首先你可以尝一下那个杯子里的水吗？ —非常好 —好的 很高兴你这么觉得 现在你可以尝一下第二杯吗？ 

—哦　这杯很槽糕 －你的反应表明你不喜欢这杯 －好吧　很显然你在里面加了洗碗液 －你怎么知道呢？ －好吧　因为它尝起来像肥皂 －这就是为什么你把它吐掉吗？ －我没有吐掉第一杯里的水　是吗？ －你可能有兴趣知道你的反映 同90%的参加实验的人是一样的 他们都更喜欢柠檬水而不是洗碗液 －那样很好 －如果你把它 带回寝室　并在 你的室友身上做实验　我打赌他们肯定也更喜欢柠檬水 －当然　他们会的 听起来很蠢　我要离开这里了 －如果这个实验只是关于柠檬水的故事　 那么它蠢透了 但它要说明的是 不同类型的归纳论证之间的不同 

我们下一步要做的是 细致地逐个观察不同类型的归纳论证 

## Generalizations

### generalizations from samples

Now that we've seen which features distinguish inductive arguments from deductive arguments, we want to look at the different kinds of inductive arguments one by one. And the first two we're going to look at are moving up from a sample to a generalization. And then moving back down from the generalization to some kind of prediction in a particular case. Generalizations are all around us. Almost all movies have credits. 

Most popular bands have drummers. Many restaurants are closed on Mondays. 

three quarters of Police officers are very nice people. 2 3rds of books have chapters in them. Half of the people I know like to play sports. And my favorite of all, 87.2% of statistics are made up on the spot. 

It should come as no surprise at all that there's so many generalizations filling our lives because generalizations can be extremely useful. Especially when you need to make a decision. So, for example, if you're feeling a little nauseous, that is a little sick at your stomach, then you need to know whether most people who have symptoms of your sort Have something serious enough that they need to go to a doctor and they also need to know whether doctors can usually help people who have symptoms of that sort. All of those generalizations are relevant to whether or not you want to go to the doctor to see if you can get some help with your sick stomach. 

But then the problem is how can we decide which generalizations to believe. Since they're generalizations and they plan all instances for a certain sort, you can't check them all out. You have to take a sample of some sort. I mean just imagine that you're running a bakery and you're making jelly doughnuts. And you want to know whether the jelly doughnuts are filled with the right amount of jelly. 

You've made hundreds of jelly doughnuts, you're not going to tear them all apart and check every one for how much jelly they have in the middle. because then you'd have no doughnuts left to sell to your customers. Or imagine that you want to buy a car. This time you're the customer. You want to buy a car and you need to know how often these cars have problems in the first year. Because if they have a problems a lot during the first year, you don't want to buy that kind of car. 

But you don't want every car of that sort to have been tested for the first year because then you can't buy a new car. You're only going to have a used car since they've all been used in the test. Or imagine that you want to know what types of tree grew during a certain period of history. So you look at the soil and you dig down and you start looking for how many pollen grains there are, at a certain level that indicates a certain age. 

Well, you can't check every spot in the field because if you did that, you'd just be destroying the entire field. So in these cases and many other cases, you just have to take samples. You can't test the whole class. And then you have to generalize from the sample to the larger class. 

All of these generalizations from samples share a certain form. 

First we look at one instance of the sample. We say that first F is G as the thing that fits in the class F and has the property G. Then we check another. The second F is also G and the third F is also G and all the rest of the Fs in the sample are G. So we conclude that all Fs are G. 

Now notice that all in the conclusion means everything in the class of Fs. It doesn't only mean the ones in our sample. So we've started from premises that are only about the sample, which is only a part of the general class. And we've reached a conclusion about the whole class when we say that all Fs are G. 

Now other arguments of the same general type are a little bit different because you don't always get complete uniformity. You don't always get all Fs are Gs, sometimes you get the first F is G, the second F is G but the third F is not G. And the fourth F is G and the fifth F is G but the sixth F is not G. So you get like 2 3rds of the Fs are G. And then you reach the conclusion, that 2 3rds of all fFs are G. Again, though, you've only looked at the f's in the sample. You've only observed a small part of that total class of all Fs. And you draw a conclusion that 2 3rds of overall class, the whole class of Fs, has that property G. So that's why you have a general, that's why it's called a generalization. You start from a smaller sample and reach a conclusion about a much larger class. You generalize to the whole class. 

The fact that the argument moves from a small part of the class to the whole class shows that it's inductive. And what does that mean? Well, first is the argument valid? Think back to one of the examples. Almost all bands that I know of have drummers. Therefore, almost all bands have drummers. Well, is it possible that the premises are true and the conclusion false? Of course, it is. Because maybe I only listen to bands that have drummers but there are a lot of bands out there that don't have drummers and I just didn't happen to listen to them. That is, they weren't part of my sample. Okay? 

And is the argument defeasible? That means that you can add further information to the premises and it'll make the argument much less strong. It might even undermine the argument totally. And, of course, it could because you could give me all kinds of examples of bands that don't have drummers and I would have to change my conclusion. That almost all bands have drummers. 

So, this argument is defeasible. Does that mean that it can't be strong? No. It could still be strong. It can come in different types of strength. How would you get a stronger argument or a weaker argument in this case? Well, you could have a larger or smaller sample. If I take a very large sample, the argument's going to be stronger. If I take a very small sample, the argument's going to be weaker. So it's not like validity, which is on or off. It's either valid or not. Instead, the strength of the argument comes in degrees depending on how big the sample is. 

Now, does that mean that since it can't be valid it can only be strong to a certain degree, that it's not good? No. Because it's an inductive argument. Inductive arguments don't even try to be valid. They don't even pretend to valid. That's not what they're supposed to be. And so you can't criticize this argument by saying it's not valid. Is doing everything that it's supposed to do, if it provides you with a strong reason and a strong enough reason for the conclusion. That's what an inductive argument is supposed to do. So, if this argument does it, it's a good argument. And even if inductive arguments including generalizations from samples don't have to be valid they still need to be strong. And so we need to figure out how to tell when a generalization from a sample is a strong argument. When it provides a strong reason for the conclusion. And to really answer that question, you gotta turn to statistics, an area of mathematics. And learn how to analyze the data much more carefully than we'll be able to do here. 

But even mentioning the name statistics raises fear in some people. 

Mark Twain is famous for having said there are three kinds of lies. There are lies There are damn lies and there are statistics. 

He actually gives credit to Disraeli for having said it first. But the point is that statistics are even worse than damn lies. You can't trust them at all. 

Or so Mark Twain says. But on the other hand, some people say, statistics? That's math! It's all about numbers! Can't question that. 

Here's one example of somebody who suggests such a position. 

There's still one thing that's irrefutable and that is the numbers. Numbers don't lie. You can't parse poll numbers. They're infallible. >>Okay fine. He knows that statistics aren't infallible. He's just being sarcastic. But there are many people who put a lot of faith in the numbers and in statistics. They seem to think that you always have to trust it when a statistician comes up with an answer. 

And we're going to learn that neither of these views is correct. It's not true the statistics were always worse than damn lies. And it's also not true that the numbers are irrefutable. The truth lies somewhere in the middle. 

现在我们已经了解到了 归纳论证和演绎论证之间的区别 接下来 我们将逐个探究不同的归纳论证 我们要看的前两个 在于从样本得到概括 然后在特定的例子中从概括往回推 得到某些预测 概况无处不在 几乎所有的电影都有演职员表 

大部分的乐队都有鼓手 很多饭店在周一都不营业 

四分之三的警察是好人 三分之二的书有章节 我认识的半数人都喜爱运动 还有我最喜欢举的例子 87.2%的统计数据 都是即兴编造 未经证实的 

我们的生活中充满了概括 这一点也不令人惊讶 因为概括可为我们提供帮助 尤其是当你需要做决定的时候 比如 如果你觉得有点恶心 也就是你的胃有点不舒服 那你就需要知道  有着相同症状的大多数人 他们的身体情况是否严重到需要就医 他们也需要知道 通常来讲 医生是否能治疗这些症状 所有这些概括都将决定你是否会选择就医 来治疗你的胃病 

但问题是我们如何判断哪些概括是可信的 因为它们是概括 它们来自某种类别的所有例子 你不可能一一检查 你必须从某种类别中选取一个样本 设想你在经营一个面包店 你做果酱甜甜圈 你想知道果酱甜甜圈里面 是否放入了适量的果酱 

你已经做了数以百计的果酱甜甜圈 你不可能把它们全部掰开 检查每一个里面有多少果酱 因为那样的话 你就没有甜甜圈可以卖给你的顾客了 或者设想你要买一辆车 这次你是顾客 你想买一辆车 你需要知道 这些车在第一年出故障的概率 因为如果它们在第一年有很多故障 你就不会想买那种车了 

但是你不会想要在第一年对相同款式的每一辆车都作测试 因为那样你就不可能买到一辆新车了 你只能买到一辆旧车 因为它们都在测试中被使用过了 或者想像一下 你想知道在历史中某个时间段 生长了哪些树木 所以你看着眼前的泥土开始挖 你开始去找里面有多少花粉粒 因为某个数量水平指示着某个年代 

但是你不可能检查每一寸土地 如果你那么做了 你就摧毁了整片土地 所以在这些例子和许多其他例子里 你要做的是选取样本 因为你不可能测试整个类别 然后你必须从样本概括到更大的类别 

所有这些从样本得到的概括都有一个特定的模式 

首先我们看一个样本的例子 首先我们看一个样本的例子 我们说第一个F是G 就是指属于F类的东西都有G的属性 然后我们看另一个 第二个F也是G 第三个也是G 样本中所有剩下的F都是G 所以我们推断出 所有F都是G 

要注意的是 结论中的“所有”意味着F类中的全部 要注意的是 结论中的“所有”意味着F类中的全部 那不仅仅表示我们样本中的F 所以当我们说所有F都是G的时候 我们仅从关于样本的前提 即总体的一部分样本 得到了一个关于总体的结论 

同类型的其它论证则稍有不同 因为你无法总得到完全一致的结论 你并不能总得到所有F都是G的结论 有时候第一个F是G 第二个F是G 但第三个F不是G 第四个是G 第五个F是G 但第六个F不是G 所以2/3的F是G 那么你得到结论 所有F中的2/3是G 同样 尽管你只看了样本中的F 你只观察了所有F中的一小部分 而你得出了整个F类别的2/3有属性G的结论 而你得出了整个F类别的2/3有属性G的结论 这就是为什么你得出的是一个概括 这就是为什么它被称作概括 你从一个比较小的样本出发 得到了一个关于更大的类别的结论 你概括到了总体 

这种从类别中一小部分得到针对整个类别的论证 属于归纳法 那意味着什么呢？那意味着什么呢？ 首先 论证是否有效呢 回想一个例子 我知道的几乎所有的乐队都有鼓手 所以几乎所有的乐队都有鼓手 有没有可能前提是真的 而结论为假？ 当然是有可能的 因为有可能我只听过有鼓手的乐队 但有很多乐队并没有鼓手 只是碰巧我没听过他们 就是说 他们不在我的样本中 对吧？ 

那么 这一论证是否是可被废止的？ 也就是说通过在前提中增加信息 使论证变得不那么有力 甚至使其彻底被推翻 当然 因为你可以给我各种没有鼓手的乐队例子 那我就必须改变我的“几乎所有乐队都有鼓手”的结论 那我就必须改变我的“几乎所有乐队都有鼓手”的结论 

所以这个论证是可被废止的 这是否意味这是个无力的论证？ 不是的 这个论证仍可能是有力的 它的有力性可以有各种形式 在这个例子中 要怎么得到一个更强有力的论证 或者较为无力的论证呢？ 你可以有一个更大或者更小的样本 如果我采用很大的样本 论证就会更强有力 如果我采用很小的样本 这个论证就会相对无力 所以这跟有效性不同 有效性只有两种情况 不是有效就是无效 相反 论证的有力性 由样本的大小程度决定 

那么 无法说明其有效性 只能说明其有力程度 是否代表这是个不好的论证呢？ 不 因为这是归纳性论证 归纳性论证从不试图证明有效 甚至不假装成是有效的 那不是这类论证的用途 所以你不能因为这个论证不是有效的而批评它 如果它给你提供了一个对结论足够有力的理由 那么这个论证就完成了自己应做的事情 那就是一个归纳论证所要做的 所以如果这个论证做到了这一点 它就是一个好的论证 即便从样本得到概括的归纳性论证不需要是有效的 他们也还是需要强有力的 所以我们需要搞清楚 怎样确定一个从样本得到的概括是一个强有力的论证 什么情况下它为结论提供了有力的理由 为了解决这个问题 你需要求助于数学领域中的统计学 学习怎样分析数据 比我们这里涉及到的更为仔细地分析 

但是即便只是提到统计这个名字 也让一些人感到恐惧了 

马克吐温 (Mark Twain) 说过一句名言 “世界上有三种谎言” “谎言 该死的谎言 和统计” 
事实上 他说这句话首次出自迪斯雷利 (Disraeli) 之口 但关键是 数据比该死的谎言还要糟糕 你完全不能相信它们 
马克吐温是这么说的 但另一方面 一些人会说 数据是什么？ 就是数学啊 那是数字的海洋 是不可质疑的 
下面这句话出自持有这种看法的某个人 
还有一个实物是无可争议的 那就是数字 数字不说谎 你无法评判民意测验的数据 它们是绝不会错的 好的 他知道统计并非无懈可击 他只是在嘲讽 但是确实有很多人对数据深信不疑 他们好像认为 当一个统计学家给出一个答案 你就必须相信它 
我们将会看到 这两种观点都是不正确的 数据并不总是比该死的谎言还要糟糕 但却也不是无可争议的 真相存在于两者之间 【果壳教育无边界字幕组】校对：aPRIltenYY 审核：LennyBear 

### when are generations strong?

So now we really gotta face that crucial question, how can we tell when a generalization from a sample is a good argument? We're not going to be able to do a lot of mathematical statistics here, that would take a whole course, and you ought to take one, it's useful it's important, it's interesting. Definitely worth taking a course on statistics. But all we're going to be able to do here, is look at some really common errors that people make. So you won't be le, misled in these obvious ways. It won't so much help you do statistical studies of your own. But it will help you avoid getting fooled by people who cite statistical studies for conclusions that you might not want to believe, to illustrate these problems, I did little survey, I happen to love chocolate chip cookies, now not all chocolate chip cookies are equally good, some of them I think have too few chips, you need a lot of chocolate chips. But you don't want too many because then it's just a bunch of chocolate and you don't get the dough. The, the butter, the sugar. That stuff's good too. So you want just the right balance here. You want, I would say, in a, say a three inch diameter cookie, you want about ten to 12 chocolate chips. 

And there happen to be five bakeries in my hometown that serve chocolate chip cookies. So. I went and got ten chocolate chip cookies from each of the five bakeries, and counted the chocolate chips in the cookies, and I found out that 80% of the chocolate chip cookies that I bought from Bakery A had ten to 12 chips in them. So I conclude that 80% of the chocolate chip cookies from Bakery A had ten to 12 chocolate chips in them. 

That sounds like a pretty good argument, doesn't it? And I could have sampled 20 or 30, but 10 is a pretty good number for a sample. So, you ought to believe that conclusion, right? There's nothing wrong with that argument, is there? 

Well what's the problem? 

The problem is, I'm lying. I didn't buy a single cookie. I didn't do this survey. 

What does that show you? That shows you, that one problem for statistical generalizations from samples, is that the premises have to be true. 

Kind of obvious. And what it shows is that, just like a valid argument's no good unless it's also sound. When it's a deductive argument. Similarly, what would be a strong argument, if the premises were true, is no good if the premises aren't true. 

But also like deductive arguments, it's not enough for the premises to be true. 

What if I counted, I really did buy the cookies and I really did count but I missed a bunch of them because I was going so fast. 

Or I couldn't count the chocolate chips very well because they were like all melted together. 

Or, maybe I got the cookies from Bakery A mixed up with the cookies from Bakery B or Bakery C or Bakery D. 

Then, I just made a mistake when I was counting the cookies. Then, it turns out the premises of the argument, of the generalization from the sample. Those premises are false. But not because I'm lying, rather because I didn't count well. So I'm unjustified. And of course it doesn't help if I'm justified, if you're not justified. You're not going to have any reason to believe this about the cookies, unless not only did I count them accurately, and carefully, and reliably but you have reason to believe that I did so. 

So the general point is simply that when you face a generalization from a sample, then the premises have to be true and justified. So the first question you ought to ask about any generalization from a sample is, are the premises true? And are they justified? 

Next let's assume that I'm honest, I'm not lying and I count carefully and thoroughly so I don't make a mistake and I'm justified in believing that I haven't made a mistake. 

I go to all five of the bakeries and I buy a cookie from each bakery and I count the chips in the, in the cookies that I bought. And it turns out that the cookie from Bakery A has 11 chips in it. And the cookies from Bakery B, Bakery C, Bakery D, Bakery E, they all have less than ten chips in them. So now I can do two of these generalizations from samples. Right? I can say, well, 100% of the cookies that I sampled from Bakery A have. Between ten and 12 chips. Therefore 100% of the cookies from Bakery A have between ten and 12 chips. But 0% of the cookies I sampled from Bakery B have ten to 12 chips. So 0% of the cookies from Bakery B have ten to 12 chips. 

what's wrong with that argument? 

Well I hope it's pretty clear the, the problem is you can't generalize from just one cookie. The cookies aren't made in a totally mechanical way where they count the chips before they put them in the cookies. Then you can't know that every cookie is the same, and if you can't know that every cookie's the same, you can't generalize. From one cookie alone, to all the cookies in the bakery, you might have gotten one that happened to have 11 chips, but all the other cookies in the bakery had less than 10. For the other bakeries for b,c,d,e, you might have gotten a cookie that had less than 10 when actually they all, all the rest of cookies in the store had between ten and 12. 

So when you generalize from such a small sample, from a sample that's too small, then it's called, the fallacy of hasty generalization. And it's so obvious, that it's hard to believe, but it's actually often committed, it's a very common fallacy. You know, your next-door neighbor will buy a new car and it breaks down, and you say, aaah, that kind of car is no good. Or you meet somebody from Sweden, and this person from Sweden likes football, and so you say, aaah, people from Sweden like football. and people just constantly generalize extremely small samples, in order for generalizations that guide their behavior in every day life. 

Sometimes they're right, a lot of times they're wrong. That's when you have the fallacy of hasty generalization. To avoid that fallacy. We need to ask a second question about generalizations from samples, namely we have to ask, is the sample large enough? 

Now I noticed that the samples come in varying sizes from just one item to almost the whole set. And so the question that we have to ask first, is it large? True, but it's not clear what that means. What we really want to know is, is it large enough? Because sometimes a very small sample can be plenty big. Just imagine that you come across an apple tree and you want to find out whether the apples off that tree float in the water. So you bring in a tub of water, you pull off an apple off the tree and you put it in the tub. And it floats. 

Now you can generalize that all the apples, or maybe almost all the apples off that tree will float in water. One is a big enough sample in that case. Now why is that? It's because you have background information from biology. That the apples on that tree are going to be very similar to each other. Because of how they arose. And so sometimes, a single instance is going to be enough. Even if it's not enough, when we're counting chips in chocolate chip cookies. 

The other point about the sample being large enough, that you need to keep in mind. Is that, whether it's large enough, depends on what the stakes are. 

If you're testing a bunch of parachutes to see if they work, you better not just check a few. Even ten is not enough, like we used for the chocolate chip cookies. You wana to check every parachute to make sure that it's packed properly, and is going to work. Or you're going to have disaster when they fail. 

Well, what about chocolate chip cookies? Suppose you take a sample of ten, and it turns out that, that sample is not really representative? Big deal, so there are nine chips, or 13 chips. You know, it's just not that serious an issue. So, a sample can be large enough, for something that doesn't matter, like chocolate chip cookies, without being large enough, for something that really does matter like, whether parachutes are packed properly. So whether the sample is large enough depends on the background information, that's what the apple case showed us And also on what's at stake. That's what the parachute case showed us. Next, let's assume that I'm not lying and the counts accurate. You're justified in believing that it's accurate. And the sample's big enough. All of that is settled. Alright? So, what I did was. I went into the five bakeries. And I turned to the person behind the counter, and I said, I'm doing this little survey, because I gotta figure out which place I want to buy my chocolate chip cookies in town. And, and I want to find out whether, how many of your cookies have between ten and 12 chocolate chips. So, could you sell me ten chocolate cookies and I'm going to do my survey. So, then I take ten cookies from each of the five bakers and I bring 'em home and I count them. And sure enough from Bakery A we found that 80% of the cookies that are bought from Bakery A have ten to 12 chips. and so I conclude that 80% of the cookies that are made in Bakery A have 10 to 12 chips. and, that seems like a pretty good argument, doesn't it? It's got a big enough sample. And if you don't believe that, let's say it's 20 cookies. 

But there's still something wrong. There's something wrong with that argument. What's wrong with that argument? 

Well, I told the guy behind the counter, I was doing this survey to figure out where I was going to buy my chocolate chip cookies. 

So if he wants me to buy chocolate chip cookies from his cookie shop, from his bakery then he's going to look in the counter for the ten cookies that look like they have about ten to 12 chips in it. So might be no surprise that 80%of the cookies that I sampled. Have ten to 12 chips because he picked out the ones that did. 

This is called the power of biased sampling. Sometimes the sample that you take is not representative of the whole, because it's biased in a certain way, in this case it was biased by the person behind the counter and what he knew about what I was doing, and what his motives were in trying to get me to buy from his shop. 

But the fallacy of biased sampling is something we have to watch out for. And what we need to do then to avoid this fallacy is to ask a third question about all generalizations from samples. 

We want to know whether the premises are true and justified. We want to know whether the sample is large enough we also have to ask Is the sample biased in any way that's going to weaken the argument? 

It might seem that the fallacy of biased sampling is so obvious that nobody who was careful and any good at what they were doing would commit that mistake. But actually people do it all the time. Some of the top pollsters in history have done it. The most famous example was Franklin Deleanor Roosevelt who was running for president in 1936 against Alf Landon and the Literary Digest did a poll that took just tons of data. I can't remember how many tens of thousands of letters they sent out. in this poll, and they reached a conclusion, form their poll that Alf Landon was going to win 56 to 44, but that's not the way it turned out. Turned out that Roosevelt won 62 to 38. They were way off, they weren't even close. So what was going on with that? 

Well they needed to get addresses of people to send the survey to, and what did they use for that? They used a phone book. 

But back then, remember this is 1936 a lot of people didn't have phones and in particular poor people didn't have phones and people who lived in a rural areas didn't have phones. And it was those poor people, and people who lived in rural areas that loved Franklin Roosevelt, because of the New Deal and all the policies that he had put in that helped them out. So they voted for him, and he won by a landslide. And the prediction had gone the other way. And it's all because of biased sampling. And the same problem continues today. Many pollsters, especially when they want to do a really quick poll, will call up people on their phones. But there are lots of restrictions and lots of problems with that. For one thing, you're not supposed to do polls on cell phones. 

But a lot of young people only have cell phones and don't have landlines. 

So that means that young people are going to be under represented in the sample. 

And even if they have a landline, well, they often have caller id, and they know it's a pollster, so they don't answer. So get very low response rates. And some studies have found that women tend to answer the phone more than men. So you get samples Screw the net direction. 

So what do you do when you get it buy a sample like this. Well if you know it's been biased in these ways, then you try to correct for that, that's where the pollsters don't all agree. They correct in different ways, because think about it. Suppose if this time. You got a lot more people from the liberal party than you did last time. That might mean that your sample is skewed! But it might mean that there are just more people who have moved over to the liberal party. Or to the conservative party. Either way, how do you know the proper way to correct, so as to get an accurate answer? And different polling organizations use different techniques. And that explains why very often the polls reach quite different results about who's ahead in a, in an election. 

Another reason why polls often reach different results, is that some pollsters are dishonest. I know it comes as a shock. But it's true. 

And pollsters can sometimes reach the conclusions that they want to reach by slanting their questions. So the fourth question that we want to ask about any generalization from samples is, was the question slanted in some way? Which means. It was phrased in a way that made it more likely to reach one result rather than a conflicting result. 

So how does this happen? 

Well a simple way to do it is to word the question in such a way that people are going to feel bad about giving a certain answer. 

So for example, if you want to find out how many people in a certain society, 

think that it's, it's wrong to experiment in scientific experiments on animals. Then you could always ask, one question if you want one answer and another question if you want another answer. So what about this one, supose they say is it okay to kill a mouse in order to save a human? 

Well I think most people are going to say yes, and then they're going to say so they, those people who gave that answer, they actually support scientific experments on mice to save human lives. Therefore they support animal experimentation. 

If you want to reach the other result in your poll, then you can say; should scientists torture animals in their experiments? 

Nobody wants to say they are going to be for torture, so their going to say no. Scientists shouldn't do that. And then, you can conclude, so most people are against animal experimentation because animal experimentation is torturing animals. 

In fact, you can go a little further, you can say, should scientists stop torturing animals in their experiments? It's like, should. When did you stop beating your wife? It presupposes that they are torturing animals. And then, people who say, of course they should stop it. I didn't even realize they were doing it. Well, you're just guaranteeing the result in your poll, by the way you ask the question. Another way to slant your questions in a poll. Is to give the survey participants limited options. So in one example the New York Times magazine reported a poll about the Doris Day Animal League where they said 51% of the people we surveyed think that chimpanzees should be treated about the same as children. 

What happened in the survey was, they were only given four options. They could say, chimpanzees should be treated like property, 

or they should be treated a lot like children, or they should be treated like adult humans Or you're not sure. 

Notice that given those options, you don't want to say chimps are like property because you can just destroy your property if you want. If you've got an old car and you want to tear it to bits with a sledgehammer, that's up to you. And 

they're not like adult humans because we don't think they should be given schooling and so on, or votes or so on. So you're pretty much left with either saying you're not sure, and you feel like well I should have thought about this a little bit. So most people were saying, 51% were saying that chimpanzees ought to be treated similar to children. 

So by limiting the options to a list where all the other options were undesirable for one reason or another the posters can get you to pick the option that they want you to pick. 

And then the next trick is you report the conclusion right. They actually didn't say. That 51% said that chimpanzees should be treated similar to children. They said that the survey showed that primates should be treated the same as children. 

They changed chimpanzees to primates which includes a lot of very small primates that aren't nearly as intelligent and close to us as chimps are. 

And they also said, it's not similar to children, the same as children. So, you can also slant the pol. Not by playing around with the question, but by playing around with the way you report the conclusion, of the survey. 

So those are some of the tricks that people use. 

in order to reach a predetermined result and to fool you into believing that their poll ,uh, results are reliable. And we saw others mistakes that people make even when they're not trying to fool you. 

So, what you need to do is to keep your eye on all those, you need to ask these questions that I emphasized throughout this lecture, namely you got to see are the premises true and justified? Is the sample large enough? 

Is the sample biased in some way? And have the questions or the conclusions been reported in a slated way? And there's a lot more to learn about statistics. And again I want to emphasize it would be useful to take a statistics course People ought to know more about statistics. But we can't go into all of those details here. Still, if you can just avoid these few simple mistakes that I've been talking about, then you can avoid being misled in a number of situations in everyday life. 

现在 我们面对了一个极其重要的问题 那就是 我们如何辨别一个来自样本的概括归纳是不是一个好的论证我们如何辨别一个来自样本的概括归纳是不是一个好的论证 我们无法在这里进行大量的数理统计我们无法在这里进行大量的数理统计  这样会占据整节课的时间 这样会占据整节课的时间 但这值得你去学 因为它有用 重要 同时也很有趣但这值得你去学 因为它有用 重要 同时也很有趣 毫无疑问 值得用一堂课的时间来讲数据统计毫无疑问 值得用一堂课的时间来讲数据统计 但我们现在能做的 只是看一些但我们现在能做的 只是看一些 人们常犯的错误人们常犯的错误 这样你就不会陷入这些明显错误这样你就不会陷入这些明显错误 这在你自己做统计研究时不会有太大帮助这在你自己做统计研究时不会有太大帮助 但是这将会帮助你避免被但是这将会帮助你避免被 那些在结论中引用你不信任的统计数据的人所愚弄那些在结论中引用你不信任的统计数据的人所愚弄 为了说明这些问题 我做了一个小调查 我很喜欢巧克力饼干我做了一个小调查 我很喜欢巧克力饼干 可并不是所有的巧克力饼干都是一样好可并不是所有的巧克力饼干都是一样好 其中一些的巧克力太少 但你想要当中有更多巧克力其中一些的巧克力太少 但你想要当中有更多巧克力 但你又不想要过多但你又不想要过多 那就成了不能称之为饼干的纯粹巧克力那就成了不能称之为饼干的纯粹巧克力 黄油 糖 这些东西也不错 所以你想要的是平衡搭配这些东西也不错 所以你想要的是平衡搭配 你想要 在我看来你想要 在我看来 在三英寸的饼干上 你想要10到12粒巧克力在三英寸的饼干上 你想要10到12粒巧克力 

而在我的家乡有五家面包店而在我的家乡有五家面包店 出售巧克力饼干出售巧克力饼干 所以 我从每家面包店都买了10个巧克力饼干我从每家面包店都买了10个巧克力饼干 数了数上面的巧克力粒 我发现在A店买的饼干中数了数上面的巧克力粒 我发现在A店买的饼干中 有80%上面都有10到12个巧克力粒有80%上面都有10到12个巧克力粒 所以我得出结论 在A买的饼干中80%在A买的饼干中80% 上面都有10到12个巧克力碎粒上面都有10到12个巧克力碎粒 

这听上去是个还不错的论证 是这样么？ 我也可以使用20 30个的样本 但是10个已经足够了我也可以使用20 30个的样本 但是10个已经足够了 所以你就应该相信这个结论 对吧所以你就应该相信这个结论 对吧 这个论证里没有任何错误是吧这个论证里没有任何错误是吧 

好吧 问题出在哪里？ 

问题出在 我在撒谎 我一个饼干都没有买 也没有做什么调查我一个饼干都没有买 也没有做什么调查 

这说明了什么 样本数理统计的一个问题是这说明了什么 样本数理统计的一个问题是 前提必须为真 

这是显然的 同时 它还说明了 正如同时 它还说明了 正如 一个论证只有当它可靠时才能有效一个论证只有当它可靠时才能有效 对演绎论证而言对演绎论证而言 同样地 前提为真时才能成为强有力的论证同样地 前提为真时才能成为强有力的论证 如果其前提不为真 则它也是无益的如果其前提不为真 则它也是无益的 

但也和演绎论证一样 只是前提为真还是不够的 

假使我真的数了巧克力粒假使我真的数了巧克力粒 也真的买了饼干也真的买了饼干 但却因为我走得太快弄丢了一些但却因为我走得太快弄丢了一些 

或者我不能数清楚巧克力碎粒 因为它们看上去都融在了一起因为它们看上去都融在了一起 

或者 也许我从A店买的饼干和或者 也许我从A店买的饼干和 和从B C D买的混在了一起和从B C D买的混在了一起 

于是 当我数数时就犯了错误 问题就这样出现在了论证的前提上问题就这样出现在了论证的前提上 和样本归纳的前提上和样本归纳的前提上 这些前提是错误的 但这不是因为我在撒谎 而是因为我没有数清楚 我没数清我没数清 即便我弄清了而你没弄清也一样没用即便我弄清了而你没弄清也一样没用 你没有理由去相信你没有理由去相信 这个关于饼干的结论 除非不仅仅我这个关于饼干的结论 除非不仅仅我 数得非常精确 小心 仔细 并且你 也有理由相信我确实是如此做的 

所以总体来说 当你面对样本归纳时所以总体来说 当你面对样本归纳时 前提必须为真并且有理由去相信它是真的前提必须为真并且有理由去相信它是真的 所以 对任何样本归纳你都应该首先问一个问题所以 对任何样本归纳你都应该首先问一个问题 前提是否为真前提是否为真 我是否有理由去相信它我是否有理由去相信它 

接下来 假设我是诚实的 我没有撒谎 并且我数得小心接下来 假设我是诚实的 我没有撒谎 并且我数得小心 因此我没有犯错误因此我没有犯错误 也有理由相信我并没有犯错误也有理由相信我并没有犯错误 

我去了这五家面包店 从每个店里都买了一个饼干我去了这五家面包店 从每个店里都买了一个饼干 并且数了上面的巧克力并且数了上面的巧克力 结果是A店的饼干有11粒巧克力结果是A店的饼干有11粒巧克力 面包店B C D E的曲奇 它们上面的巧克力都少于10粒它们上面的巧克力都少于10粒 所以我可以从样本中得到其中两个归纳 对吧? 我可以说 从A店买的样本里 100%我可以说 从A店买的样本里 100% 都含有10到12粒巧克力都含有10到12粒巧克力 因此 A店的饼干100%上面都有10到12粒巧克力因此 A店的饼干100%上面都有10到12粒巧克力 而B的样本中0%含有10到12粒巧克力而B的样本中0%含有10到12粒巧克力 所以 B的饼干中 0%含有10到12粒巧克力所以 B的饼干中 0%含有10到12粒巧克力 

这个论证有什么错误 

这很明显这很明显 问题在于不能仅用一个饼干样本来归纳全体问题在于不能仅用一个饼干样本来归纳全体 饼干并不完全是由流水线生产的饼干并不完全是由流水线生产的 生产前数数上面的巧克力数生产前数数上面的巧克力数 因此你也不可能知道每个饼干都一样因此你也不可能知道每个饼干都一样 如果你不知道每个饼干都一样 就不能这样归纳如果你不知道每个饼干都一样 就不能这样归纳 仅从一个饼干就归纳整个店里的饼干仅从一个饼干就归纳整个店里的饼干 你有可能碰巧拿到了有11粒巧克力的饼干而已你有可能碰巧拿到了有11粒巧克力的饼干而已 但其他饼干可能都少于10粒巧克力但其他饼干可能都少于10粒巧克力 对于其他的面包店B C D E 你可能 碰巧拿到了一个少于10粒巧克力的饼干碰巧拿到了一个少于10粒巧克力的饼干 但实际上是 他们店里所有其它的 饼干都有10到12粒饼干都有10到12粒 

所以 当你从这样一个小的样本中归纳时 如此之小的样本 这就被称为 草率归纳的谬论如此之小的样本 这就被称为 草率归纳的谬论 这太明显了 让人很难去相信这太明显了 让人很难去相信 但事实上它却常常发生 一个非常常见的谬论但事实上它却常常发生 一个非常常见的谬论 你知道了隔壁的邻居买了一辆新车 但是这辆车却你知道了隔壁的邻居买了一辆新车 但是这辆车却 发生了故障 然后你说 啊 这种车真差劲发生了故障 然后你说 啊 这种车真差劲 或者你遇到了一个瑞典人 他喜欢足球或者你遇到了一个瑞典人 他喜欢足球 然后你因此说 啊 瑞典人都喜欢足球 人们常常从极小的样本里得出结论人们常常从极小的样本里得出结论 来作为日常生活的经验来作为日常生活的经验 

有时他们碰巧对了 但往往这都是错的有时他们碰巧对了 但往往这都是错的 当你遇到这种草率归纳的谬论时当你遇到这种草率归纳的谬论时 避免犯这种错误避免犯这种错误 关于样本归纳 我们需要问出第二个问题 即 我们必须要问 样本是否足够多？ 

我注意到样本数目有各种不同 从仅一个样本到几乎整个系列从仅一个样本到几乎整个系列 我们首先需要思考的问题是 这数目是否很大我们首先需要思考的问题是 这数目是否很大 但这个问题的意义并不清晰但这个问题的意义并不清晰 但这个问题的意义并不清晰也并不清晰 我们其实想知道的是 这个数目是否足够大我们其实想知道的是 这个数目是否足够大 因为有时候一个数量非常小的样本也可以足够大因为有时候一个数量非常小的样本也可以足够大 想象一下 你看到一棵苹果树想象一下 你看到一棵苹果树 你想知道树上的苹果是否会漂在水面上你想知道树上的苹果是否会漂在水面上 于是你拿来一桶水于是你拿来一桶水 把一个苹果摘下来 然后把它放入桶中把一个苹果摘下来 然后把它放入桶中 苹果漂浮在水面苹果漂浮在水面 

现在你可以归纳出 所有的苹果现在你可以归纳出 所有的苹果 或者是几乎所有那棵树上苹果都可以漂浮在水面上或者是几乎所有那棵树上苹果都可以漂浮在水面上 在这种情况下 一个样本已经足够了 为什么会这样呢？为什么会这样呢？ 这是因为你拥有生物学的背景知识 那棵树上的所有苹果都是非常相似的那棵树上的所有苹果都是非常相似的 因为这些苹果的生长方式都相同因为这些苹果的生长方式都相同 因此有些时候 个例就已经足够了 即使在我们数饼干里面的巧克力时 样本数量不足即使在我们数饼干里面的巧克力时 样本数量不足 即使在我们数饼干里面的巧克力时 样本数量不足即使在我们数饼干里面的巧克力时 样本数量不足 

另一个需要记住的要点是另一个需要记住的要点是 样本数量是否足够大 取决于其利害关系样本数量是否足够大 取决于其利害关系 样本数量是否足够大 取决于其利害关系样本数量是否足够大 取决于其利害关系 

如果你在测试一些降落伞是否合格 你最好不要只检查一部分 像检验饼干里巧克力数量一例一样 就算检查10个也是不够的像检验饼干里巧克力数量一例一样 就算检查10个也是不够的 你需要检查每一个降落伞来确认 它们都正确地折叠好 并且是能够使用的它们都正确地折叠好 并且是能够使用的 否则 如果它们不起作用的话 你会很麻烦否则 如果它们不起作用的话 你会很麻烦 

那么 回到巧克力奇普饼干一例那么 回到巧克力奇普饼干一例 假设你取了十个样本假设你取了十个样本 而结果是这些样本不具有代表性而结果是这些样本不具有代表性 一块饼干有9颗或者13颗巧克力 没什么大不了一块饼干有9颗或者13颗巧克力 没什么大不了 这不是一个很严肃的问题这不是一个很严肃的问题 所以 一个样本数量对于一些无关轻重的问题来说 已经足够大所以 一个样本数量对于一些无关轻重的问题来说 已经足够大 就像巧克力奇普饼干一例一样 但对于一些真的很重要的事情就像巧克力奇普饼干一例一样 但对于一些真的很重要的事情 比如降落伞是否适当地折叠来说 是不足够的比如降落伞是否适当地折叠来说 是不足够的 所以样本是否足够大取决于问题的背景所以样本是否足够大取决于问题的背景 比如苹果这个例子 也取决于其利害关系比如苹果这个例子 也取决于其利害关系 如降落伞这个例子 下面 让我们假设我并没有撒谎如降落伞这个例子 下面 让我们假设我并没有撒谎 并且巧克力碎粒的数目也是精确的并且巧克力碎粒的数目也是精确的 你也相信这数字是精确的你也相信这数字是精确的 同时样本数量足够大 所有问题都已解决了 不是么所有问题都已解决了 不是么 所以 我所做的是 我去这五家面包店所以 我所做的是 我去这五家面包店 对收银台的工作人员说 “我正在做一个小调查”对收银台的工作人员说 “我正在做一个小调查” “因为我想知道在这个镇子里”“因为我想知道在这个镇子里” “我应该去哪儿买巧克力奇普饼干”“我应该去哪儿买巧克力奇普饼干” “我还想知道你这里的饼干”“我还想知道你这里的饼干” “巧克力碎粒数量在10到12粒之间的有多少块”“巧克力碎粒数量在10到12粒之间的有多少块” “所以 你能够卖我十个饼干吗 这样我就可以进行调查了”“所以 你能够卖我十个饼干吗 这样我就可以进行调查了” 于是我在五家面包店分别买了10个饼干于是我在五家面包店分别买了10个饼干 然后我带回了家 并且数上面的巧克力碎粒然后我带回了家 并且数上面的巧克力碎粒 可以肯定的是 我们发现面包店 A 80%的饼干可以肯定的是 我们发现面包店 A 80%的饼干 上面有10到12颗碎粒上面有10到12颗碎粒 因此我得出结论 面包店 A 中 80% 的饼干因此我得出结论 面包店 A 中 80% 的饼干 上面有10到12粒巧克力碎粒 而且常常会包括有很多之后用不上的分析 并且 这看上去是不是一个很不错的论证这看上去是不是一个很不错的论证 它有足够大的样本容量 如果你不相信 我们可以改成20个曲奇如果你不相信 我们可以改成20个曲奇 

但是这个论证里仍旧有问题但是这个论证里仍旧有问题 这里的论证仍有问题这里的论证仍有问题 这个论证错在哪里呢 

我告诉了收银台的那个人 我正在做一个调查我告诉了收银台的那个人 我正在做一个调查 来决定我应该在哪里买巧克力奇普饼干来决定我应该在哪里买巧克力奇普饼干 

所以如果他想让我在他的店里买巧克力奇普饼干的话所以如果他想让我在他的店里买巧克力奇普饼干的话 他就可以在柜台里找十个他就可以在柜台里找十个 看上去有10到12颗碎粒的的曲奇看上去有10到12颗碎粒的的曲奇 所以其结果并不令人惊讶 我取样的80%的曲奇中所以其结果并不令人惊讶 我取样的80%的曲奇中 都有10到12个碎粒 因为这是他挑出来的都有10到12个碎粒 因为这是他挑出来的 

这就叫做取样偏差 有的时候你的样本并不具备代表性 是因为它在一定程度上有一些偏差是因为它在一定程度上有一些偏差 这个案例里的偏差来自收银台的人这个案例里的偏差来自收银台的人 这个人知道我在做什么这个人知道我在做什么 而他的动机是试着让我在他的店里购物而他的动机是试着让我在他的店里购物 

我们必须注意到取样偏差的谬误我们必须注意到取样偏差的谬误 为了避免这样的谬误为了避免这样的谬误 我们需要自问关于样本归纳的第三个问题我们需要自问关于样本归纳的第三个问题 

我们想知道前提是不是正确和合理我们想知道前提是不是正确和合理 我们想要知道样本是不是足够大我们想要知道样本是不是足够大 我们还必须问样本偏差是否会在一定程度上削弱论证我们还必须问样本偏差是否会在一定程度上削弱论证 

取样偏差的谬误看起来太明显取样偏差的谬误看起来太明显 任何谨慎和擅长所做事情的人都不会犯这样的错误任何谨慎和擅长所做事情的人都不会犯这样的错误 但实际上人们总是犯这样的错误但实际上人们总是犯这样的错误 但实际上人们总是犯这样的错误但实际上人们总是犯这样的错误 历史上一些顶尖民意调查人士就犯过这种错误历史上一些顶尖民意调查人士就犯过这种错误 最有名的例子是富兰克林·德拉诺·罗斯福 (Franklin Delano Roosevelt)最有名的例子是富兰克林·德拉诺·罗斯福 (Franklin Delano Roosevelt) 在1936年与阿尔夫·兰登 (Alf Landon) 竞选美国总统的时候在1936年与阿尔夫·兰登 (Alf Landon) 竞选美国总统的时候 《文学文摘 (Literary Digest) 》杂志做了一个大规模的民意调查《文学文摘 (Literary Digest) 》杂志做了一个大规模的民意调查 我不记得他们寄了多少万封信我不记得他们寄了多少万封信 在那次民意调查中 他们得出一个结论 阿尔夫·兰登将以 56% 比 44% 支持率在大选中获胜他们得出一个结论 阿尔夫·兰登将以 56% 比 44% 支持率在大选中获胜 但是结果却不是这样 罗斯福以 62% 比 38% 的支持率当选但是结果却不是这样 罗斯福以 62% 比 38% 的支持率当选 他们错得太离谱了 跟结果一点儿都不沾边他们错得太离谱了 跟结果一点儿都不沾边 那次调查到底出现什么问题那次调查到底出现什么问题 

当时杂志需要得到人们的地址来寄送调查单当时杂志需要得到人们的地址来寄送调查单 他们用什么方式找到这些地址 他们用了一本电话本他们用什么方式找到这些地址 他们用了一本电话本 

但是那个时候 要知道这是1936年 但是那个时候 要知道这是1936年  很多人 尤其是穷人 并没有电话很多人 尤其是穷人 并没有电话 住在乡下的人们没有电话 就是这些穷人  住在乡下的穷人 他们把票投给了富兰克林·罗斯福住在乡下的穷人 他们把票投给了富兰克林·罗斯福 因为“罗斯福新政”以及所有他推出的政策帮助了他们因为“罗斯福新政”以及所有他推出的政策帮助了他们 因为“罗斯福新政”以及所有他推出的政策帮助了他们因为“罗斯福新政”以及所有他推出的政策帮助了他们 所以这些人给罗斯福投了票 让他获得了压倒性的胜利所以这些人给罗斯福投了票 让他获得了压倒性的胜利 而杂志社的预测却是给出出相反的结论而杂志社的预测却是给出出相反的结论 这一切全因为取样偏差 而同样的问题今天仍然出现这一切全因为取样偏差 而同样的问题今天仍然出现 许多民意调查的人会打电话给受访许多民意调查的人会打电话给受访 尤其是当他们想要进行快速调查的时候尤其是当他们想要进行快速调查的时候 但是这样有很多的限制和问题 一方面 他们并不会拨打移动电话做民意调查一方面 他们并不会拨打移动电话做民意调查 

但是很多年轻人只有手机而没有座机但是很多年轻人只有手机而没有座机 

这意味着年轻人在这个样本中没有体现这意味着年轻人在这个样本中没有体现 

即使他们有座机 他们经常有来电显示即使他们有座机 他们经常有来电显示 他们知道这是一个民意调查 就不会回答他们知道这是一个民意调查 就不会回答 因此调查返回率非常低因此调查返回率非常低 有些研究者发现女人比男人更容易接电话 所以你的样本偏重了女性所以你的样本偏重了女性 

因此当你拿到有偏差样本时该怎么做呢因此当你拿到有偏差样本时该怎么做呢 如果你知道它在哪些方面有偏差如果你知道它在哪些方面有偏差 那么就试着去纠正它 这是调查人士公认的做法那么就试着去纠正它 这是调查人士公认的做法 他们用不同的方式去纠正 因为想想看 假设这次 你抽样样本里有更多自由党成员你抽样样本里有更多自由党成员 这可能意味着你的样本是有偏差的这可能意味着你的样本是有偏差的 但也可能仅表示更多人偏向支持自由党但也可能仅表示更多人偏向支持自由党 但也可能仅表示更多人偏向支持自由党但也可能仅表示更多人偏向支持自由党 或者是支持保守党或者是支持保守党 不管怎样 你怎么确定一个合适的方法去纠正偏差不管怎样 你怎么确定一个合适的方法去纠正偏差 以便得到一个精确的答案呢以便得到一个精确的答案呢 不同的调查组织使用不同的方法不同的调查组织使用不同的方法 这就解释了为什么各种关于谁在选举中领先的民意调查 会有着完全不同的结果会有着完全不同的结果 

另一个民意调查为什么会有不同结果的原因是另一个民意调查为什么会有不同结果的原因是 这些调查组织或调查人不诚实这些调查组织或调查人不诚实 我知道这很让人震惊 但这是事实但这是事实 

民调者有时会通过提问有偏向性的问题来得到他们想要的结果民调者有时会通过提问有偏向性的问题来得到他们想要的结果 民调者有时会通过提问有偏向性的问题来得到他们想要的结果民调者有时会通过提问有偏向性的问题来得到他们想要的结果 所以第四个我们想要问的问题所以第四个我们想要问的问题 关于样本概括的问题是 问题是否在一定程度上有倾斜关于样本概括的问题是 问题是否在一定程度上有倾斜 也就是说 问题提问的方式是否更有可能诱导受访者问题提问的方式是否更有可能诱导受访者 让他们回答其中一个答案 而不是与其对立的答案让他们回答其中一个答案 而不是与其对立的答案 

这是怎么一回事这是怎么一回事 

一个简单的方法就是把问题的提问方式改成一个简单的方法就是把问题的提问方式改成 人们会对特定答案持不良印象的写法人们会对特定答案持不良印象的写法 

比如 如果你希望了解在某个地区中比如 如果你希望了解在某个地区中 

有多少人认为在动物上进行科学实验是不对的有多少人认为在动物上进行科学实验是不对的 你经常可以为了得到一个特定的答案而问一个问题你经常可以为了得到一个特定的答案而问一个问题 为了得到另一个特定的答案而问另一个问题为了得到另一个特定的答案而问另一个问题 比如这个例子比如这个例子 假如他们问到: 杀死一只老鼠来救一个人可以吗假如他们问到: 杀死一只老鼠来救一个人可以吗 

我觉得大多数人会说可以 然后他们会说 这些回答这个答案的人然后他们会说 这些回答这个答案的人 然后他们会说 这些回答这个答案的人然后他们会说 这些回答这个答案的人 实际上支持用老鼠做实验来拯救人的生命实际上支持用老鼠做实验来拯救人的生命 因此他们支持动物实验 

如果你想要在民调中得到另一个结果 你可以问 科学家们可以在他们的实验中折磨动物吗你可以问 科学家们可以在他们的实验中折磨动物吗 你可以问 科学家们可以在他们的实验中折磨动物吗你可以问 科学家们可以在他们的实验中折磨动物吗 

没有人会说动物是用来折磨的 所以他们会说不可以没有人会说动物是用来折磨的 所以他们会说不可以 科学家们不能那样做 于是你可以总结说于是你可以总结说 大多数人反对动物实验大多数人反对动物实验 因为动物实验是在折磨动物 

事实上 你可以再推广得远一点事实上 你可以再推广得远一点 你可以问 科学家们应该停止在他们的实验中折磨动物吗？你可以问 科学家们应该停止在他们的实验中折磨动物吗？ 这就像再问这就像再问 你什么时候停止殴打你妻子你什么时候停止殴打你妻子 这个问题以科学家折磨动物为先决条件这个问题以科学家折磨动物为先决条件 然后人们就说 当然 他们应该停止然后人们就说 当然 他们应该停止 我从来就不知道他们在做这件事 这样你通过改变提问方式控制了调查结果这样你通过改变提问方式控制了调查结果 这样你通过改变提问方式控制了调查结果这样你通过改变提问方式控制了调查结果 另一种在民调中倾斜问题的方法另一种在民调中倾斜问题的方法 是给受访者有限的选项是给受访者有限的选项 例如《纽约时报 (New York Times) 》杂志报道了一个例如《纽约时报 (New York Times) 》杂志报道了一个 由多丽丝·黛动物联盟 (Doris Day Animal League) 发起的民调显示由多丽丝·黛动物联盟 (Doris Day Animal League) 发起的民调显示 51%受访者认为黑猩猩应该像孩子一样对待51%受访者认为黑猩猩应该像孩子一样对待 

事实上 在调查中他们仅给出四个选项事实上 在调查中他们仅给出四个选项 分别是 “黑猩猩应该像财产一样对待”分别是 “黑猩猩应该像财产一样对待” 

“黑猩猩应该像孩子一样对待”“黑猩猩应该像孩子一样对待” “黑猩猩应该像大人一样对待” 以及 “不确定”“黑猩猩应该像大人一样对待” 以及 “不确定” 

注意一下这些选项 你不会想说黑猩猩像财产注意一下这些选项 你不会想说黑猩猩像财产 因为如果你愿意的话 你可以毁掉你的财产因为如果你愿意的话 你可以毁掉你的财产 如果你有一辆老轿车如果你有一辆老轿车 而你希望用一把大锤敲碎它 这取决于你而你希望用一把大锤敲碎它 这取决于你 所以它占三分之一 

它们不像成人 因为我们不认为它们不像成人 因为我们不认为 黑猩猩应该给予教育 或者允许投票之类的事情黑猩猩应该给予教育 或者允许投票之类的事情 所以基本上只剩下 要么说你不确定所以基本上只剩下 要么说你不确定 以及你觉得你应该思考一下这件事以及你觉得你应该思考一下这件事 所以大多数人 51%的受访者说所以大多数人 51%的受访者说 黑猩猩应该像孩子一样对待黑猩猩应该像孩子一样对待 

因此通过限制选项因此通过限制选项 让其它的选项因为这样或者那样的原因不可取让其它的选项因为这样或者那样的原因不可取 调查者可以让你选择他们希望你选择的选项调查者可以让你选择他们希望你选择的选项 调查者可以让你选择他们希望你选择的选项调查者可以让你选择他们希望你选择的选项 

然后下一个伎俩就是汇报结果然后下一个伎俩就是汇报结果 事实上他们没有说事实上他们没有说 那51%的受访人说过 黑猩猩应该像孩子一样对待那51%的受访人说过 黑猩猩应该像孩子一样对待 他们只是说这次调查 显示灵长类动物应该像孩子一样对待显示灵长类动物应该像孩子一样对待 

他们把黑猩猩换成了灵长类动物 这包括很多小型灵长类动物他们把黑猩猩换成了灵长类动物 这包括很多小型灵长类动物 它们的智力并不像黑猩猩那样与人类相近它们的智力并不像黑猩猩那样与人类相近 

他们还说 不是与孩子有相似对待 而是与孩子有一致对待他们还说 不是与孩子有相似对待 而是与孩子有一致对待 因此你也可以不通过玩弄问题来倾斜民调因此你也可以不通过玩弄问题来倾斜民调 而是通过玩弄你汇报调查结论的方式而是通过玩弄你汇报调查结论的方式 而是通过玩弄你汇报调查结论的方式而是通过玩弄你汇报调查结论的方式 

这就是一些调查者使用的伎俩这就是一些调查者使用的伎俩 

为了得到一个早已决定好的结论为了得到一个早已决定好的结论 以及欺骗你相信他们民调结果的可靠性以及欺骗你相信他们民调结果的可靠性 我们也看到一些人们犯过的其它错误我们也看到一些人们犯过的其它错误 就算他们并不打算欺骗你就算他们并不打算欺骗你 

因此你需要留意这里所有因素因此你需要留意这里所有因素 你需要提出这些我这节课强调过的问题你需要提出这些我这节课强调过的问题 换句话说你应该看一下前提是不是真实合理换句话说你应该看一下前提是不是真实合理 样本是否足够大样本是否足够大 

样本会在某程度上是否有偏差样本会在某程度上是否有偏差 以及问题和结论是否倾斜以及问题和结论是否倾斜 我们还有更多关于统计学的东西需要学习我们还有更多关于统计学的东西需要学习 我想再次强调 上统计学课程会很有用 人们应该更多了解统计学上统计学课程会很有用 人们应该更多了解统计学 但是我们没法在这里说得太仔细但是我们没法在这里说得太仔细 当然了 如果你能避免这些我谈到过的简单错误当然了 如果你能避免这些我谈到过的简单错误 你就能避免在日常生活中的被各种情况误导你就能避免在日常生活中的被各种情况误导 

### applying generations

Generalizations are not much use if you can't apply them back to particular cases. 

It rains about 35% of the days in North Carolina. Great, but is it going to rain tomorrow? That's what I want to know. I don't want to know the general statistics. I want to know about tomorrow, cause I gotta decide where to go to a 

picnic. 65% of the snakes in this are are poisonous. Great. But, I want to know whether the one I'm stepping on right now is poisonous. I don't want to know the general statistics. 

So we need some way to take these generalizations, and apply them down to particular cases. And that's the job of a form of argument we're going to call, application of the generalization. Not a great name, but they're usually called, statistical syllogisms, and that's an even worse name. Because they're not really necessarily statistical in a mathematical sense, because they don't have to have numbers in them. 

And they're also not syllogisms like the categorical syllogisms that you studied back in the section on deductive arguments. So we're going to call them applications of generalizations. And they just happen all the time. They really do. You might say, for example, I almost never Like horror movies. And that's a horror movie. So I don't want to go to it. 

because I'm not going to like it. Or you might say, I don't want to invest in that restaurant because 80% of restaurants fail during the first two or three years. 

And so, this is a restaurant that's new. It's probably going to fail too. Or, how about this one? 

Most people who are on the track team are pretty thin. Well 

now, you know there are some exceptions to that, like the people who throw shot put that's what I used to do. 

But still, it's true that most of them do, so if you know that Sally is on the track team. 

That's all you know about her. Then, you got some reason to believe that Sally's probably thin. She might throw the shot put but there're are many more people on the track team who run and jump and they're going to be thin if they're any good at it. 

so. Although it might be wrong, it's a pretty good bet that Sally's thin if she's on the track team. And that's the kind of argument that we're going to call an application of a generalization. 

Here's my favorite. Am I wearing shoes right now? Can't see, can you? Maybe I am, maybe I'm not. 

But most professors wear shoes when they're teaching a class. 

Walter is a professor who's teaching a class. So Walter is probably wearing shoes right now. That's an application of a generalization. 

And has the same form Is the other examples that we saw before. 

To see that form we can substitute variables for the terms in the English argument. 

So we can substitute the letter F for the reference class, which is the set of professors who were teaching Then we can substitute the letter G for what's called the attribute class which is the people who are wearing shoes. 

Then we can substitute the letter A usually in lower case for the individual that we're talking about. In this case that individual is me, Walter. 

And we can substitute X % for the quantifier. If it's most or almost all or something like that then X% takes its place. And then the form of the argument. That I just gave about wearing shoes is simply that X% of F are G, a is F, therefore a is probably G. Notice that this application of a generalization moves in the opposite direction from the generalization from the sample. 

We might start off saying; well X% of the F's in the sample are G. So X% of F's are G. And that's generalization from a sample. But then we take the generalization in that conclusion and use it as a premise. In its, in an application. 

So we say X% of F's are G, a is F, therefore a is probably G. 

And that's why I said that we're going to study up to generalizations, and then down from generalizations 

in this part of the course. And when they work together, we can use information about the sample To reach a conclusion about the individual. 

Which is pretty useful. Notice also that these applications or generalizations are inductive. They share all the features of inductive arguments. First of all, they're invalid because it's possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. That is, it's possible that X% of F are G, a isn't F, but it's not true that a is probably G. There might be no chance at all that a is G. 

Second, applications of generalizations are defeasible. You can add additional information to the premises that make the argument very weak. They might completely undermine the argument. For example, even if you know that Walter is a professor and most professors wear shoes while they're teaching, a little bit of additional information might show you. That it's just not true, that Walter is wearing shoes while he's teaching. 

By the way, I'm going to, well, you'll have to decide for yourself whether I'm really putting my shoes back on now. 

But the third feature of inductive arguments, is that, they're strong. Or they can be strong, they can vary in strength. So, even if, I don't have shoes on, it still might be a fairly strong argument that almost all professors wear shoes while they're teaching. Walter's a professor and he's teaching therefore he probably has shoes on. That could be strong before you get that additional information. Before you see my feet without shoes on. And now that you don't know whether I've got shoes on, it can still be a strong argument. 

So, we have arguments that are not valid, and they're defeasible. And they vary in strength. And that makes them inductive arguments. 

So how do we tell when an application of a generalization really is strong? That is, when does it provide strong reasons for the conclusion? 

Now the first standard should be obvious. It's the same for generalizations from samples the premises have to be true and justified. 

If it's not true that I'm a professor or if it's not true that I'm teaching or you have no reason to believe you're not justified in believing that I'm a professor or I'm teaching Then, the argument that we've been looking at can't give you a good reason to believe that I'm wearing shoes because I just don't fall in the classes that we're talking about. 

Secondly. 

A standard that's specific to these kinds of arguments is that the strength of the argument varies with how big X is. If X is 99%, so 99% of F's are G's, and a is an F, that's a pretty strong argument that this a is a G. 

But if it's 60%, then it's not a very strong argument. So 99's going to be stronger than 90, which is stronger than 80, which is stronger than 70, which is stronger than 60. And the strength of the inductive argument can vary as the percentage X varies. 

And notice if X is 10%, then it becomes a pretty strong argument for the opposite conclusion. If only 10% of professors wear shoes when they're teaching, And I'm a professor who's teaching, then it's pretty likely I'm not wearing shoes. 

And that's stronger than if it's 20, and 30, and 40. And when you get close to the middle, the 50%, if 50% of professors wear shoes when they're teaching, and I'm a professor, then you can't really reach a conclusion one way or the other about it. Whether I'm wearing shoes. At least, not on the basis of that evidence. Not on the basis of that argument. Okay, so a second standard for assessing applications of generalizations is to figure out what the percentage is. But, another crucial. 

Feature of applications and generalizations, is that there can be conflicting reference classes. 

So it might be true that 95% of professors wear shoes when they're teaching. 

But I'm not just any old professor, I'm an online professor. This course is online, and that's very different. Because most professors wear shoes when they teach, because the students we'll see their bare feet. But you can't see my bare feet, so maybe, it turns out that a lot of online professors are really not wearing shoes when they teach. 

So. That's a conflicting reference class. It's a different reference class that conflicts because it points to a different conclusion than the original reference class. The original reference class was professors who are teaching. The conflicting reference class is online professors who are teaching, or professors who are teaching online. When you run into conflicting reference classes, as a general rule what you ought to do is look at the smallest of those reference classes. because that's usually going to give you a better estimate of how likely it is that this individual has the general attribute. That is, how likely it is that a is G. 

So, if you want to know whether Walter is wearing shoes, you shouldn't look at the broad class of all professors, but should instead look at the narrow class of online professors, if the course that he's teaching right now is an online course. 

But there's a problem that you might run into also. As you get a narrower and narrower reference class, you sometimes just don't have enough data to figure out what the exact percentage is. How do you know what the percentage of professors who are teaching online is, that are wearing shoes. How many of them are wearing shoes? I've never seen a survey. I've seen lots of professors give regular lectures, but you rarely see the feet of online professors, so you might not have enough information to apply that generalization. 

So, while the narrower reference class of two reference classes that conflict Can be more accurate. It can also be problematic if you don't have enough information to support the premise that says that a certain percentage of that class, that F, have the general attribute G. 

The fallacy of overlooking conflicting reference classes can be a little confusing. But, it's very important. So, let's look at another example. And this time, let's focus on a medical example. 

Let's suppose that, 90% of the people with a certain condition, certain medical condition, a certain illness, die. And Bob has that illness. So it looks very likely that Bob will die. 

And this is an application of the generalization About people with this illness. 

But now suppose, we find out that most people catch this illness when they're old, but Bob is quite young. So, it turns out that young people with this illness usually survive. Matter of fact Only about 20% of the people with this illness who get it when they're young, die from the illness. But Bob is young and has this illness. So now we can reach the conclusion that he probably won't die from the illness. 

But wait a minute. 

We may have another conflicting reference class. 

because Bob has a heart condition. And it turns out that even young people, when they catch this illness, if they have a heart condition they usually die. Matter of fact, 80% of the people with this illness who have a heart condition, and are young, die from this illness. 

So Bob, who is young and has this illness and also has a heart condition, 

would probably die from this illness. 

But wait a minute, it turns out that there's a new treatment, and 

of the people who were given this treatment, only about Thirty percent of them die even if they're young, with this illness, with a heart condition, and Bob lives in an area where he can get the treatment. So now it looks like there's only a 30% chance that Bob will die from this illness. 

So what's happening here is as we get more and more informaiton The likelihood of Bob dying from this illness starts out really high and then it goes low, and then it goes high again and then it goes low again, and it goes back and forth as we get more information. 

And then the question arises, Which of these different generalizations should we use to figure out how likely it is that Bob will die from the illness? 

And the answer here, as with most cases of conflicting reference classes, is that we ought to look at the narrowest class that we can. because if we know there's a treatment. And Bob is young and he has a heart condition and he also has this illness and we put all that together and compare him to other people who are young with this illness and a heart condition who can get the treatment and look at how many of them have died in order to form an estimate of how likely it is that Bob will die from this illness. So we always want to look at the narrowest reference class that we can in order to get the best estimate of the probability in the conclusion. 

But then there's a problem. It might not be very many people. Remember its a new treatment. So there are not very many people who are young who have this illness to begin with. Remember most of the people with the illness are old. And the treatment's new so it hasn't been tried on very many young people and, of course young people don't often have heart conditions, so it might be very difficult to find enough people who were like Bob in all the essentials respects in order to determine whether or not Bob would probably die from this illness. So there is a kind of a tension here. More information gives us more accuracy but only if we have enough information to be justified in trusting the premises of the application that we're looking at and that's one of the tricks in figuring out how to estimate. Whether or not Bob is likely to die from the illness. The same points apply to all kinds of examples. 

You know, if you want to know the climate in the area, that's going to be a generalization about days around here at this time of year. 

But if you want to know the weather tomorrow you need to apply it. And then you're going to need to look at specifically what the weather was yesterday. Specifically what the humidity is. The more information you can build in, the better estimate of what the weather's going to be tomorrow. 

Or, if you want to bet on a sport's team. You say, well, they're a very good team. They've won most of their games in the last five years. But wait a minute. Maybe all their players left, and now it's not likely that they're going to win. But wait a minute, they got new players that are even better. That makes it more likely they're going to win. And, again, the information can make the probability go low, and then high, and then low, and then high. And you have to get the most specific information you can to get the most accurate estimate of how likely it is that this team will win. 

But you might not have enough information about this team with these players under these circumstances because we just have period of cases we need to observe. So here's what the medical example this can be get tension between one in the most precise, the most smallest reference class among the different conflicting reference classes. And yet, you need premises that you have enough information that you can justify them. And if you can reach that perfect point, and you've got enough information to justify the premises, but that premise is specific enough so that it has all the relevant information about the case. That's when you're going to have the best outcome. Our applications of generalizations. [BLANK_AUDIO]

大多数田径队的人都很瘦 好吧 

当然也有一些例外 比方说当然也有一些例外 比方说 铅球运动员 我以前就做过铅球运动员 我以前就做过 

尽管如此 田径队的大多数人都很瘦 因此尽管如此 田径队的大多数人都很瘦 因此 如果你知道萨莉在田径队如果你知道萨莉在田径队 

你也只是知道她在田径队你也只是知道她在田径队 那么你就有理由相信 萨莉很可能很瘦那么你就有理由相信 萨莉很可能很瘦 她可能是投铅球的 但是田径队里其他更多的人她可能是投铅球的 但是田径队里其他更多的人 从事跑步或者跳高 如果他们成绩还不错那一准都很瘦从事跑步或者跳高 如果他们成绩还不错那一准都很瘦 

接下来 尽管可能会错 但萨莉很瘦这点 是个不错的推测尽管可能会错 但萨莉很瘦这点 是个不错的推测 如果她是田径队一员的话如果她是田径队一员的话 以上这些是我们称之为  概括的应用 的论证概括的应用 的论证 

现在说个我最喜欢的例子 猜猜我现在穿鞋了吗现在说个我最喜欢的例子 猜猜我现在穿鞋了吗 你看不见 是吧 可能我穿了鞋 也可能没穿你看不见 是吧 可能我穿了鞋 也可能没穿 

但大多数的教授在上课时穿着鞋子但大多数的教授在上课时穿着鞋子 

沃特教授正在上课沃特教授正在上课 所以沃特现在很可能穿着鞋所以沃特现在很可能穿着鞋 这是对概括的一个应用这是对概括的一个应用 

我们之前看到的例子有跟它相同的格式 

要理解这个格式 我们可以在英文论证里用变量要理解这个格式 我们可以在英文论证里用变量 替换掉一些术语替换掉一些术语 

所以我们可以用字母F所以我们可以用字母F 代替参考类 (reference class) 它在这里是指代替参考类 (reference class) 它在这里是指 上课的教授 接下来我们用字母G替换掉上课的教授 接下来我们用字母G替换掉 属类 (attribute class) 指穿鞋的人们属类 (attribute class) 指穿鞋的人们 

之后我们用字母a之后我们用字母a 通常是小写 来代替我们所讨论的通常是小写 来代替我们所讨论的 个体个体 在这个例子当中 这个个体是我 沃特 

此外 我们可以用X%替代量词 如果它是“大多数” “几乎所有”或者类似 就用X%就替换如果它是“大多数” “几乎所有”或者类似 就用X%就替换 这样 论证的形式这样 论证的形式 就简化为 X%的F是就简化为 X%的F是 G 如果a是F 那么a就很可能是GG 如果a是F 那么a就很可能是G 注意 这个概括的应用与注意 这个概括的应用与 样本中的概括是两个相反的方向样本中的概括是两个相反的方向 

我们可以说 样本中X%的F是G我们可以说 样本中X%的F是G 所以X%的F是G 这是从一个样本得到的概括所以X%的F是G 这是从一个样本得到的概括 我们又把概括放在结论里并把它作为一个前提我们又把概括放在结论里并把它作为一个前提 在一个应用中在一个应用中 

于是 X%的F是G a是F 因此a很可能是G于是 X%的F是G a是F 因此a很可能是G 

这就是为什么我说我们要学习概括这就是为什么我说我们要学习概括 然后再从概括然后再从概括 

延展到这门课的这个部分延展到这门课的这个部分 把它们结合起来 我们就可以通过样本把它们结合起来 我们就可以通过样本 来得到关于个体的结论来得到关于个体的结论 

这是非常有用的这是非常有用的 同样注意 应用或概括是归纳性的同样注意 应用或概括是归纳性的 它们有着归纳论证的所有特性 首先 它们是无效的 因为可能存在首先 它们是无效的 因为可能存在 前提是真而结论是假的情况前提是真而结论是假的情况 也就是说 X%的F是G也就是说 X%的F是G 而a不是F a很可能是G这个结论却是假而a不是F a很可能是G这个结论却是假 可能压根a就不是G可能压根a就不是G 

其次 概括的应用是可以可辩驳的其次 概括的应用是可以可辩驳的 完全可以在前提中加入些信息使论证变得无力完全可以在前提中加入些信息使论证变得无力 它们可能完全破坏掉这个论证 比方说 即使沃特是教授 并且大多数教授比方说 即使沃特是教授 并且大多数教授 上课的时候穿着鞋 但加入一些额外信息上课的时候穿着鞋 但加入一些额外信息 就能让 沃特上课穿着鞋 变为假就能让 沃特上课穿着鞋 变为假 

顺便说一下 你得自己思考顺便说一下 你得自己思考 我现在是不是真的把鞋穿上了我现在是不是真的把鞋穿上了 

而归纳论证的第三个特点是 牢固而归纳论证的第三个特点是 牢固 或者说它们很牢固 但在强度上有所不同或者说它们很牢固 但在强度上有所不同 所以 就算我没穿鞋 它仍可能是一个相当有力的论证所以 就算我没穿鞋 它仍可能是一个相当有力的论证 即 绝大多数教授在上课时穿着鞋子即 绝大多数教授在上课时穿着鞋子 沃特是个教授 所以他在上课时很可能穿着鞋 沃特是个教授 所以他在上课时很可能穿着鞋  这个论证仍然可能很坚固这个论证仍然可能很坚固 除非又加入了额外信息除非又加入了额外信息 比如 在你看到我脚上没有鞋比如 在你看到我脚上没有鞋 现在你不知道我是不是穿着鞋子 它就还是一个强论证它就还是一个强论证 

我们看到了无效的可废止的论证我们看到了无效的可废止的论证 它们的强度可能不同 这些特点就是归纳论证它们的强度可能不同 这些特点就是归纳论证 

那么你怎么分辨一个概括的应用那么你怎么分辨一个概括的应用 是不是真的有力呢？是不是真的有力呢？ 也就是说 什么时候它为结论提供强推理？ 

第一个标准应该很明显 这跟从样本的概括相同这跟从样本的概括相同 前提必须是真且得到验证前提必须是真且得到验证 

如果 我是一个教授 或者 我正在上课 是假的 或者没有能让你确信或者没有能让你确信 我是一个教授或我是一个教授或 我正在上课 那么 这个论证我正在上课 那么 这个论证 就不足以让你相信就不足以让你相信 我正穿着鞋子 因为我不属于我正穿着鞋子 因为我不属于 我们正在讨论的这个情形我们正在讨论的这个情形 

其次 

一个专门用于这类论证的标准是 论证的强度与X多大有关 如果X是99% 即99%的F是G a是F如果X是99% 即99%的F是G a是F 那么 a是G就是一个很强的论证那么 a是G就是一个很强的论证 

但如果X是60% 它就不是一个很强的论证但如果X是60% 它就不是一个很强的论证 所以99比90要强 90比80要强 80比70要强 它又比 60更强 这个归纳论证的强度随着百分比X变化而变化 

注意 如果X是10% 那么注意 如果X是10% 那么 与它相反的论证就会是个很强的论证与它相反的论证就会是个很强的论证 如果只有10%的教授在上课时穿着鞋 而我如果只有10%的教授在上课时穿着鞋 而我 又是个正在上课的教授 那么很可能我没穿鞋又是个正在上课的教授 那么很可能我没穿鞋 

这比比例是20 30和40时都要强这比比例是20 30和40时都要强 当你接近中值 50% 的时候 如果50%的教授在上课的时候穿鞋 并且我是一个教授 那么你就不能并且我是一个教授 那么你就不能 得到任何一个方面的结论 关于我有没有穿着鞋 至少 没有根据能让你得出结论至少 没有根据能让你得出结论 不能根据这个论证得出结论不能根据这个论证得出结论 好了 第二个评估概括应用的标准是好了 第二个评估概括应用的标准是 明确百分比明确百分比 但是 应用和概括的另一个但是 应用和概括的另一个 

至关重要的特点是 可以存在冲突的参照类 

95%的教授在他们上课的时候穿着鞋 

但是我不是一个 传统的教授 我是一个在网络上的教授 这是一门在线课程 这就非常不一样了 因为绝大多数的教授在上课的时候穿着鞋 不然学生们可以看见他们的光脚不然学生们可以看见他们的光脚 但你们看不见我的光脚 所以有可能但你们看不见我的光脚 所以有可能 非常多线上的教授在上课的时候没有穿着鞋 

所以 这是一个有冲突的参考类 是一个不同的参考类起了冲突 因为它 指向了与原始参照类不同的结论指向了与原始参照类不同的结论 原本的参照类是正在上课的教授 冲突参照类是正在上课的线上教授 或者说正在线上授课的教授 当你遇到冲突参照类时当你遇到冲突参照类时 通用的规则是你应该着眼于这些参考类中通用的规则是你应该着眼于这些参考类中 最小的那个 因为这样通常会得出一个更有效的评估因为这样通常会得出一个更有效的评估 即 个体具有一般性的属性的可能性即 个体具有一般性的属性的可能性 亦即 a有多大的可能性是G亦即 a有多大的可能性是G 

所以 如果你想要知道沃特有没有 穿着鞋 你不应该考察所有教授这个广泛的参考类  而应该考察 线上教授这个有限的参考类 如果他正在 上的课是一个线上课程 

但是还有一个问题你也可能遇到 当你得到越来越局限的参考类时 有时候你 没有足够的数据来得出准确的百分比是多少 怎么能知道正在网上授课的教授穿着鞋怎么能知道正在网上授课的教授穿着鞋 的百分比是多少？ 他们当中有多少穿着鞋？ 我从来没见过这样的调查 我见过很多常规上课的教授 但是你几乎看不到 在网上上课的教授的脚 所以你可能没有 足够的信息来应用概括足够的信息来应用概括 

所以 在两个冲突参照类中所以 在两个冲突参照类中 范围较小的那个参照类更准确 同样 你也可能遇到麻烦同样 你也可能遇到麻烦 当没有足够的信息来支撑当没有足够的信息来支撑 确切百分比的这个前提时确切百分比的这个前提时 有多少F是G的比例有多少F是G的比例 

忽视冲突参照系 这种谬误忽视冲突参照系 这种谬误 可能有一点令人困惑 但它是非常重要的 所以我们来看另一个例子但它是非常重要的 所以我们来看另一个例子 这次我们关注一个医学案例 

我们假设 有一个特定的疾病我们假设 有一个特定的疾病 患有这种疾病 90%的人会死患有这种疾病 90%的人会死 所以它占三分之一 鲍勃患有这种疾病 所以鲍勃很可能会死鲍勃患有这种疾病 所以鲍勃很可能会死 

这就是一个应用这就是一个应用 有关人们患病的概括的应用有关人们患病的概括的应用 

继续假设 我们发现 绝大多数患者是老人继续假设 我们发现 绝大多数患者是老人 但是鲍勃还很年轻 因此但是鲍勃还很年轻 因此 而年轻人患这个病通常都能活下来而年轻人患这个病通常都能活下来 事实上 只有约20%的年轻患者事实上 只有约20%的年轻患者 死于这个病死于这个病 但是鲍勃年轻并且得了病但是鲍勃年轻并且得了病 所以我们能得出他很可能不会死于这个病的结论所以我们能得出他很可能不会死于这个病的结论 

不过 等一下不过 等一下 

我们可能有另一个冲突的参考类 

鲍勃有心脏病 而即使是年轻人鲍勃有心脏病 而即使是年轻人 当他们还患有心脏病时 他们一般都会死当他们还患有心脏病时 他们一般都会死 事实是 80%患此病且有心脏病的年轻人事实是 80%患此病且有心脏病的年轻人 死于这个疾病死于这个疾病 

所以患有此病且心脏有病的鲍勃所以患有此病且心脏有病的鲍勃 

很可能会被这种疾病夺去生命很可能会被这种疾病夺去生命 

但等一下 现在又有一种新的疗法但等一下 现在又有一种新的疗法 

接受这种治疗的患者 只有30%会死亡接受这种治疗的患者 只有30%会死亡 即使他们年轻且有心脏疾病即使他们年轻且有心脏疾病 而鲍勃生活的地区可以接受这个治疗而鲍勃生活的地区可以接受这个治疗 所以现在看来所以现在看来 鲍勃只有30%的可能会死于这种疾病鲍勃只有30%的可能会死于这种疾病 

所以 随着我们得到越来越多的信息所以 随着我们得到越来越多的信息 鲍勃死于这种疾病的可能性从很高鲍勃死于这种疾病的可能性从很高 降低 再变高 再降低降低 再变高 再降低 随着我们得到更多信息 这一可能性也上下浮动随着我们得到更多信息 这一可能性也上下浮动 

那么问题就来了那么问题就来了 我们应该用哪一种概括来我们应该用哪一种概括来 判断鲍勃死于这种疾病的可能性呢判断鲍勃死于这种疾病的可能性呢 

和其他冲突的参照类案例一样和其他冲突的参照类案例一样 这里应该选范围最窄的一类这里应该选范围最窄的一类 因为如果我们知道有新的疗法因为如果我们知道有新的疗法 知道鲍勃很年轻 有心脏问题知道鲍勃很年轻 有心脏问题 且患有这种疾病 我们把这些情况综合起来且患有这种疾病 我们把这些情况综合起来 将他和其他有相同条件的人进行比较将他和其他有相同条件的人进行比较 然后观察他们中有多少会因为这种疾病去世然后观察他们中有多少会因为这种疾病去世 这样来估计鲍勃死于这种疾病的可能性这样来估计鲍勃死于这种疾病的可能性 所以我们总是要着眼于最窄的参考类所以我们总是要着眼于最窄的参考类 以在结论中得到对可能性最准确的以在结论中得到对可能性最准确的 估计估计 

但是又有一个问题 那就是人数可能不够但是又有一个问题 那就是人数可能不够 注意 这是一个新的治疗方案注意 这是一个新的治疗方案 而且没有很多患这种病的年轻人的例子来统计而且没有很多患这种病的年轻人的例子来统计 而大多数患有这种疾病的都是老年人而大多数患有这种疾病的都是老年人 并且这个治疗方案很新 所以没有很多并且这个治疗方案很新 所以没有很多 年轻人尝试过 而且通常年轻人年轻人尝试过 而且通常年轻人 也不会心脏有心脏病 所以要找到足够多也不会心脏有心脏病 所以要找到足够多 与鲍勃所有条件一样的人与鲍勃所有条件一样的人 来决定鲍勃是否有可能来决定鲍勃是否有可能 因这种疾病去世是很难的因这种疾病去世是很难的 这里还有些麻烦这里还有些麻烦 就是我们掌握的信息越多 准确性就越高就是我们掌握的信息越多 准确性就越高 但只有当我们掌握了足够多的信息但只有当我们掌握了足够多的信息 我们才能确信应用的前提我们才能确信应用的前提 这是在评估可能性时会碰到的一个问题这是在评估可能性时会碰到的一个问题 鲍勃是否会死于这个疾病鲍勃是否会死于这个疾病 同样的观点适用于各种例子同样的观点适用于各种例子

### another example of applying generalizations(optional)

So it turns out the New Hampshire primaries aren't so primary anymore. 

On a somber note, local graveskeeper John Brown is dead. He worked at the Eternal Sleep Cemetery for 50 years, and his loss will truly be known throughout this town. 

This Bad Stat News exclusive is brought to you by Mountain Dew's newest drink, Livewire. It'll wake up anyone. Now for a commercial break. >>Everybody needs life insurance, and Chump, I mean, Champ Life Insurance Company provides the best policy. Our double policy pays double if you die twice and costs on- [SOUND]. [SOUND]. [SOUND]. >>Hi. >>Hello? >>I just wanted to confirm something that I saw on your news report. Is it true that John Brown is dead? >>Absolutely. >>Oh. Well, forgive me if I'm a little skeptical. You see, it is very unusual for me to be the last one to know about these things. >>Why is that? 

Never mind that. Just tell me how you know that he's dead. >>I saw his body in the graveyard. >>So? >>95% of all bodies in graveyards are dead. We did the research ourselves. 

So we're confident that John Brown is dead. >>I see. Well, thanks a lot. I'll see you real soon. >>Good, I guess. >>Did you notice? Did you notice? 

The news anchor just used a statistical application. Pretty cool, huh? 

Here it is in standard form. Over 95% of bodies in graveyards are dead. John Brown's body is in a graveyard. So, probably, John Brown is dead. 

The premises are true and justified. The percentage is high. So this statistical application looks pretty good so far. >>Beatrice, get me Bernie, my soul accountant. >>Howdy, Grimmeister. >>Mm, that was quick, Bernie. >>Oh, I could never make you wait, sir. Emily Dickinson notwithstanding. [LAUGH]. >>Yeah. Tell me, Bernie. 

What do I pay you for? >>Why, for the best accountancy since Enron, sir. >>That's right, and you've done a fine job of it ever since I transferred you to the Mortality and Afterlife Division of death.com. But answer me this. How can we maintain our position in the M&A Industry if we don't have accurate information? >>Sir! >>My spreadsheet shows John Brown is alive, but the news just reported that he is very much dead. 

I just called them up, and they seemed to have a good basis for their report. >>Well, what's that? >>John Brown is in a graveyard, and over 95% of the bodies in a graveyard are dead. >>Well, that's true, sir, but there's more to the story. He is still above ground. I put a GPS locator in his clothes, and it clearly indicates that he is above ground. >>So? >>So, over 95% of bodies above ground are alive. So John Brown is most likely alive. >>Well, I'm not convinced. I'm confused. >>Now we're in a dilemma. We seem to have two equally strong statistical applications for conclusions that both cannot both be true. 

Here's the news anchor's argument. Compare that with the soul accountant's argument. You can't believe both conclusions, but how can you tell which one to believe? 

Are you trying to trick me? You completely disregarded the news report. You only consider how many bodies above ground are alive. But we both know that John Brown is in a graveyard. >>Fine, you caught me. You're not about to send me to hell for a little mistake, are you? [LAUGH]. Well, besides, my point still holds. We just need to include all the relevant information. Over 90% of bodies above ground in graveyards are alive. So John Brown is probably still alive too. I bet he's just enjoying the beautiful weather or doing his job as a groundskeeper. >>What did Bernie just do? 

He resolved the dilemma by combining the two reference classes. The news anchor talked about bodies in graveyards. Bernie talked about bodies above ground. Now Bernie combines the two reference classes and talks about bodies that have both features, bodies that are above ground and in graveyards. Notice that the percentage went down from 95 to 90. The percentage often goes down when you combine conflicting reference classes. But the argument is still stronger because it incorporates all of the relevent information that we know so far. 

We have made progress. >>Well, that makes sense. 

I guess the news was wrong. Not the first time. [LAUGH] You just can't count on them any more. >>[LAUGH] Well, now, about that raise that I want. >>Not now. I have to get this John Brown story straightened out. [SOUND]. I love redial. [SOUND]. >>Yello. >>Hi. It's me again. Listen, I'm a big fan of your work in general. I think that you've really put the spotlight on some of my better 

investments. But this time, you've messed up. >>Calm down. What's the problem? >>The problem is that your report was based on a weak argument. My sources tell me that although 95% of the bodies in a graveyard are dead, John's body is above ground, and over 90% of the bodies that are above ground in graveyards are alive. 

Thanks for the scoop. It's 91.37 actually. And I don't think it applies to John Brown, because John Brown was lying down. >>Hold on. I know that trick. Lots of live people lie down in graveyards. >>You didn't let me finish. John Brown, he was John Brown was lying down in a coffin. Over 97% of all people lying down in a coffin are dead. >>Oh, I see. Well, thank you. I'll be talking to you soon. >>[LAUGH] Idiot. >>Now the news anchor has moved to an even smaller reference class that incorporates the information that John Brown is lying in a coffin. 

This new reference class makes the statistical application even stronger, because it includes more information than any of the preceding arguments. So for now, the news anchor is winning the debate. >>Bernie! [SOUND]. >>Yes, sir. >>Am I an idiot? >>No, sir. >>Am I a buffoon? >>No, sir. >>Am I an imbecile? >>No, sir. >>What am I then? >>A reified, non-material entity. >>Damn straight. And furthermore, I happen to be your boss. And as such, I do not expect failure from you. Do you know the penalty for failure? >>Well, yes, but I'd rather really not talk about it. Anyway, how did I fail? >>You told me that John Brown's body is above ground. >>Well, yes, my GPS indicates that. >>Well, does your fancy GPS also happen to tell you that John Brown's body is in a coffin? >>no, sir. >>His body is in a coffin. And I'm sure you realize that most bodies in coffins happen to be dead. >>[LAUGH] I guess so. [LAUGH] But oh, Super Sickler, did you happen to ask what John was wearing? >>No, why would I ask that? >>Because he still has his overalls on. My GPS clearly indicates that his overalls are right next to his body. >>So? >>So dead bodies are often buried in fancy suits or dresses, [LAUGH] not in overalls. 

I think I see your point. >>In fact, less than 3% of bodies in overalls are dead, even if they are lying in a coffin in a graveyard. So in all likelihood, John Brown is not dead after all. >>This new statistical application is negative. It draws a negative conclusion from a low percentage. But the fact that its form is negative doesn't change its force. This statistical application still conflicts with the news anchor's report. So we have a new dilemma. >>Well, now I'm confused again. Why would he be in a coffin if he's wearing overalls? >>Well, I don't know. I'm going to check it out for you, oh Mondo Mortifier. [SOUND]. 

[SOUND]. >>Aah! >>Calm down. >>Who are you? >>I wouldn't worry about it. We're in the same line of work, you and I. Only you're in export and I'm in import. >>Hm, if we're in the same business, I suppose you know the motto? >>Yes. >>Buy low. >>And sell lower. [LAUGH]. >>[LAUGH] What can I do for you? >>Well, I hear that John Brown works here? >>He does, but he's on a break right now. He needs a little rest on account of the heat. >>Really? I heard he was in a coffin. >>Well, yes, that's probably true. Since the budget cuts, we don't have much money for sofas or couches. [LAUGH] Besides, you wouldn't want to sleep on the rocky ground, would you? So he takes a body out of the coffin, and takes a nap on the silky smooth interior that we guarantee for all of our customers here. >>Well, I'm very happy to hear that. You don't understand. But isn't it a little strange? >>Strange? Strange? Who among us hasn't slept in a coffin, hm? Hm? [LAUGH] >>Well, that's really swell. But unfortunately, I have to get going now, so thanks. >>Oh. [SOUND]. >>Wha? Where'd you go? 

I'm back, GR, and I've got the real scoop this time. John Brown is taking a nap in a coffin. >>Are you sure? I'm sick of embarrassing myself with that news anchor. >>Idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot,. 

Yes, I'm sure. His boss told me. John Brown is taking a nap, and over 99% of people taking naps in coffins or elsewhere are alive. >>Maybe it's even 100%. But at least it's 99%. >>So he's alive. >>Well, that sounds conclusive to me. Good work, but I'd better give the news anchor one more try. Stay here while I call her. [SOUND]. >>Talk to me. >>Hey, it's me, again. >>Hey, superfan, how are you? You know, if you're so interested in what's going down at the station, I can throw you a couple of free passes, you can come down for a live taping. >>Oh, I don't think you want to meet me in person. >>Why not? You're a funny guy. >>Hm, you should see my deadpan. 

Okay. What can I do for you? >>Get your facts straight. I just found out that John Brown went into that coffin to take a nap. >>Really? >>Yes. >>But is he still alive? >>Well, I suppose. 

Heard he had a heart problem. >>Oh. I'll check it out. >>Bye. >>At this point, nobody gives a statistical application explicitly. But implicit arguments can still guide our conversations and our actions. The news anchor and the reaper seem to be thinking in terms of an argument something like this. 

A significant number of people with weak hearts die. 

John Brown has a weak heart. So there's a significant chance that John Brown is dead. 

This argument does not reach a definite conclusion as the others did. 

But it still has the same basic form as statistical applications and it can undermine their strength. 

The fact that John Brown has a weak heart puts him in yet another conflicting reference class. That's why the reaper has to check it out. >>Well, you heard her, now go check it out. >>You wish is my command, oh Rocking Reapster. 

Come on, come on. Oh, fiddlesticks! 

What's your problem? >>I thought you were dead. >>I was dead tired. 

Feeling pretty refreshed now, though. Back to work. 

[SOUND]. >>Hello. >>Now I'm absolutely sure he's alive. I spoke with him myself. >>Oh, you'd better be right this time. >>I'd stake my life on it. >>Well, you are staking your life on it. Hold on. Let me just switch lines. >>Hey, hey. >>Hi, it's me. >>Hi, I could've guessed it was you. >>But this time I know for sure that John Brown is alive. My assistant just spoke to him. >>Fine, I don't care that much. It's not that hot a story. I'll retract it. I have a better story. It's personal interest- [SOUND]. >>They're retracting their story. But if John Brown is really dead, you will be too. I don't like people who make a fool out of me. >>Do not worry, my cowled comrade. He's alive. >>It looks as if this debate is over. And Bernie won. 

His final statistical application meets all of the standards for strength in statistical applications. However, even the strongest statistical application is inductive. 

It doesn't even pretend to meet the deductive standard of validity. 

It admits that it's possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion still be false. 

Moreover, inductive arguments, including statistical applications, are defeasible. That means that new additional information that arises later might undermine the strength of the argument. 

Of course, more information that you find out even later can make the argument strong again, because it can tell you a new reference class that will allow you to make a strong statistical application using that new reference class. So as you find out more and more information, the argument that you're able to give can move from a very strong argument to a very weak argument, and back to a very strong argument, and then back to a very weak argument. And then it becomes strong. And then weak. And then strong. And then weak. And then strong. And then weak. And then strong. And then weak, and then strong and then weak, and then strong and then weak. This process can go on forever. So, inductive arguments like this can never get you certainty. 

But in fact, it's not clear that any other kind of argument is going to get you certainty. And inductive arguments can give you overwhelming evidence that's extremely unlikely to be undermined by any further discoveries. 

You still don't get certainty, but you might get everything that can be reasonably expected in this life. 

## Explanations and Analogies

### inference to the best explanation

Perhaps the most common kind of inductive argument is called an inference to the best explanation. And to understand this kind of argument we need to think way back to the first week when we discussed the difference between justification and explanation. If somebody uses an argument to justify a conclusion. Then they are trying to give a reason to believe that the conclusion is true and may be you didn't believe that conclusion before you heard the argument. 

But if somebody gives an argument to explain the conclusion and they're taking it for granted that the thing they were explaining is true and they are trying to understand why it's true and the argument is supposed to help us understand why it's true. 

Now the weird thing about an inference to the best explanation is it really combines these two. 

It uses the argument to justify belief in the conclusion. That is, to give you a reason to believe that it's true. And yet, a premise of the argument is that that conclusion explains. A phenomenon that you took for granted. 

Inferences of the best explanation are extremely common. For example, almost every detective story uses an inferences of the best explanation. Just imagine that there are three suspects and you know that one of those three suspects must have done it because. The door wasn't jimmied open, so whoever got into the room must have had a key. And there are only three people who had keys. But one of them couldn't have been the one who did it, because she has really small feet. And the footprints outside of the door are really large, and so it couldn't have been her. And the second person couldn't have done it because they have an alibi on the other side of town. So it must have been the third person who did it. Notice what you did is, you can't explain why the door wasn't jimmied by the person who got in because there were no marks and that means that the best explanation of that must be that the person who did it had a key. 

And the best explanation why the footprints were so large, was that it was a large person who wore large shoes, and the best explanation of why the alibi would place the person on the other side of town was that they were being honest assuming it's not their brother they're not that kind of person who would lie or so on. So the best explanation. Of why the jewels are missing from the room. Or why there's a dead body in the room. is that this third suspect is the one who did it. So all the detective stories work like that. It's almost always an inference to the best explanation. The best explanation is: he's the one who did it. The one implication of this, is that no matter what Sherlock Holmes says. The form of reasoning that he was using, was inductive reason, not deduction, as he claimed. 

It's not only detective novels, it's also science that uses inference as the best explanation. Take, for example, the greatest murder mystery in history, what killed the dinosaurs? 

Well some people think that it was mammals eating their eggs. Not a chance. That doesn't explain why there were also mass extinctions in the oceans, where the mammals weren't eating their eggs. Well some people think that the best explanation is that there were. Big volcanic eruptions in southern India. That seems pretty unlikely too because the volcanoes that we know, didn't put out enough material to kill things all the way around the world. 

So. We think that the best explanation of what killed the dinosaurs is that a giant meteor hit in the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. And that produced lots of soot in the atmosphere that killed the dinosaurs, as well as many other species at the time. But luckily, not mammals. And so. We now have a best explanation in science and a lot of scientific theories work that way. As a matter of fact, the point of most scientific theories is to provide the best explanation of all the experimental data, that has been observed by scientist throughout the world. 

And of course we also use inference to the best explanation in our every day lives. To try to figure out what's going on around us. Here's an example. Whoa, what was that? A drop of water just hit my head. It must be a leak in the roof. 

Now that is an inference to the best explanation. Starts with an observation of the water hitting my head. Then I think about why the water would be coming down. And the best explanation I can come up with is that there's a leak in the roof. 

So I conclude that there is a leak in the roof. 

Notice. That this argument uses an explanation but it runs in the opposite direction from an ordinary explanation. In an explanation the premises explain the conclusion. And the conclusion describes the phenomenon that was observed. 

When there is a leak in the roof water drops through the roof. 

When water comes through the roof, it drops on to whatever is in its way. I am in its way, therefore, water drops onto me. This explains that. In contrast, an inference to the best explanation works in the opposite direction. 

The conclusion is what does the explaining. The premises are what get explained. And the point is to justify belief in the conclusion, not to explain it. Water drops onto me. A leak in the roof would explain why water drops onto me. No better explanation is available, therefore there must be a leak in the roof. 

Notice that the conclusion of the left argument is a premise of the right argument. And the conclusion of the right argument is part of a premise of the left argument. 

So, the form is different. The function is different as well. In the explanation on the left, we start out already knowing that the conclusion is true. 

In the inference to the best explanation, on the right, we argue that that conclusion is probably true because it is the best explanation of the observation in the first premise. 

That's why we call it an inference to the best explanation. 

Is this argument valid? Yes or no? Right, it's not valid because it's possible for the premises to be true, and the conclusion false. Now, does its invalidity. Make the argument bad? Yes or no? Right it does not make it bad, because an inductive argument can be good even if it's invalid. The next question is a bit trickier. Remember that an argument is defeasible. If further information can make the argument weak. So, is this argument defeasible? Yes or no? Right, it is defeasible because further information could make this argument weak. So what? 

Does its defeasibility mean that this argument was weak even before we got that additional information. Yes or no? No. Because inductive arguments can be strong even though they are defeasible. 

So now we know that this argument is invalid, and is defeasible, but it still might be strong and good. 

最常见的一种归纳论证也许 就是最佳解释推理 为了理解这种论证方式 我们需要回到第一周的课程 在那一周课程中 我们讨论了辩护和辩解的不同 如果某人用论证的方式对一个结论进行辩护 那么他们会努力的拿出论据证明“结论为真” 也许你在听到论证前并不相信这个结论 

但是如果有人用论证去解释结论 他们是理所当然地认为他们所解释的事情 是真的并且试图去理解“结论为真”的原因 而论证是为了帮助我们理解“结论为真”的原因 

现在最佳解释推理的令人讶异之处在于 它是真的将两者进行了结合 

它用辩护的方式来论证结论 即提供一个“结论为真”的论据 然后论证的前提由结论来解释 这现象理所当然 @这现象似乎理所当然 

最佳解释推理非常常见 比如 几乎每本侦探小说 都会使用最佳解释推理 想像一下这里有三个嫌疑人 而你知道 其中有一个必然是罪犯  因为门不是撬开的 所以任何进屋的人一定有钥匙 而只有这三个人有钥匙 但是其中一个人不是罪犯 因为她的脚太小了 而门外的脚印 非常大 所以不可能是她 第二个人也不可能是罪犯 因为他有不在场证明 他在镇上另一边 所以罪犯一定是第三个 请注意你刚刚做的推论 你并没有解释门为什么 @请注意你刚刚做的推论 你无法解释门是被撬开的 没有被进门的人撬开 @因为门上没有被撬开的痕迹 门没有被撬开的痕迹 那最佳解释 @ 所以最佳解释是 就是罪犯一定有钥匙 

而脚印很大的最佳解释是 罪犯是一个脚大的成年人 不在场证明的最佳解释 镇子上其他人的证言 这些人和嫌疑人不是兄弟 (没有亲属等利益关系)  这些人也没有说谎 (都是诚实的人)  所以这就是最佳解释 为什么珠宝会从房间不翼而飞 或者为什么房间里会有具尸体 就是这第三个嫌疑人做的 所以侦探小说里都是这么写的 几乎都是用最佳解释推论 最优解释就是 他就是那个罪犯 无论夏洛克·福尔摩斯怎么描述他的推论 他所用的推理方法归根究底 就是归纳推理 而不是他所说的演绎推理 

最佳解释推理不仅在侦探小说中有所运用 在科学研究中也得到同样使用 比如 史上神秘的谋杀案 谁杀死了恐龙？ 

有的人说是哺乳动物吃了它们的蛋 这绝不可能 因为这无法解释为什么海洋生物也出现大面积灭绝 在海里 哺乳动物可吃不了它们的蛋 那么 有一些人认为最佳解释就是 印度南部的大型火山爆发 这听起来也不可能 因为我们都知道 火山喷发的喷出物并没有毁灭全世界的能力 

所以 我们认为杀死恐龙的最优解释是 有一个巨大的陨石坠落在墨西哥湾的尤卡坦半岛 从而产生了大量烟灰 在空气中 这些烟灰造成了恐龙乃至许多其他物种的灭绝 幸运的是 哺乳动物没事 所以 我们现在有了一个科学的最佳解释 许多科学理论都是这样产生的 事实上 大多数科学理论的作用就是提供 所有实验数据的最佳解释 这些数据被全球的科学家 所反复验证 

当然我们在日常生活中也用到最佳解释推理 来理解我们身边的一切 比如说 喔 那是什么 一滴水滴到我头上了 那一定是屋顶漏了 

瞧 这就是最佳解释推理 从水滴到头上 的观察开始 然后我就想水为什么会滴下来 我能想到的最优解释就是屋顶漏了 

所以我判定屋顶漏了 

请注意请注意 这个论证用到了解释的推理方法 但是 它的思维方向和通常的解释是相反的 在解释方式的推理中 前提 是解释结论的 而结论是来描述你所观察到的现象 

当屋顶漏了时 水会从屋顶滴下来 

当水滴下来时 它会按照自己的轨迹滴在任何东西上 我在轨迹上 所以 水滴在了 我的身上 这个解释了那个现象 相比之下 最佳解释推理的 推论是反方向的 

结论解释前提 前提被解释了 辩护理念的关键在于结论 而非解释 @它的关键在于辩护为什么要相信结论 而非解释结论 水滴在我身上 屋顶漏了可以解释为什么水滴在我身上 没有更好的更合理的解释了 所以一定是屋顶漏了 

注意到左侧论证的结论 是右侧论证的前提 而右侧论证的结论是左侧论证的前提的一部分 

所以格式不一样 功能也不一样 在左侧的解释里 一开始就知道结论为真 

在右侧的最佳解释推理中 我们推论结论可能为真 因为它只是 最佳解释推理中的一个前提 

这就是为什么我们称之为最佳解释推理 

这个论证有效么？ 有效推理还是无效推理？ 好吧 它是无效的 因为前提有可能为真 但是结论为假 这就是它的无效性 因此这是个坏的论证了吗？是或不是？ 好吧 它不会因此成为坏论证 因为归纳式论证就算无效 论证也可以很好 下一个问题难一点 请记住 论证具有可辩驳性 如果有更多的信息 可以弱化这个论证 那么论证依然具有可辩驳性吗？ 有还是没有呢？ 好吧 它依然具有可辩驳性 因为新增信息是可以 弱化论证 那又怎么样呢？ 

可辩驳性是否意味着这个论证在我们 新增信息前就已经很弱了呢？是还是不是？ 不是的 尽管具有可辩驳性 归纳论证的论证效力依然很强 

所以现在我们知道了 虽然这种论证方式是无效的 可辩驳性的 但它的论证效力依然很强 

### which explanation is best

[BLANK_AUDIO]. We've learned that inferences to the best explanation are inductive arguments. They're not valid, and they are defeasible. 

But still, they might be strong and good arguments. They might give you good reasons to believe their conclusions. Great, they might be, sure, but how do you tell whether they really are strong arguments and good arguments? We need standards to determine when an inference to the best explanation is a good argument. 

And to understand those standards, we're going to view another skit made by my students a few years ago. >>It's time for class. [CROSSTALK] >>Whoa, where is everybody? >>Beats me. It's Monday, isn't it? >>Yeah, first day of the week, remember the weekend? >>Hmmm, the weekend. [NOISE] Yeah, I remember, vaguely. Good times. Now, it's back to work. 

It's Monday, but what time is it? >>It's 11:15. >>Well, isn't that when class is supposed to start? >>Here's the start of a good explanation. There are surprising circumstances that need to be explained. >>Yeah, maybe my watch is fast, it has been giving me some trouble lately. Do you check yours? >>Oh, I don't wear a watch. I just ask you when I need to know the time. >>Great, so I'm your designated timekeeper. >>kind of, but there's usually a clock around. One right there. >>Okay, so we know it's 11:15. >>Right. >>In any inference to the best explanation, it's crucial to get an accurate picture of what you're trying to explain. In this case, if it were 11:10 instead of 11:15, then the explanation would be different, or there might be nothing at all to explain. 

So where is everybody? >>Well, maybe everybody else is late. After all, the professor does show up a few minutes late. He told me that he doesn't like to start teaching right away, because he doesn't like when he's talking and the students walk in. >>Oh, that makes me mad. >>So maybe, they're coming in later, because they don't want to wait around for him to start talking. It's one of those vicious circles. >>Okay, maybe that's it, but then some students should start showing up, so let's just wait and see [SOUND]. 

Enough is enough. 

If people were coming they'd be here by now. I mean the professor's been late but he's never been this late. >>Ann refutes Bob's explanation, by pointing out new facts that falsify Bob's hypothesis, that all the students are late. A good explanation has to be compatible with all of the facts, not just the particular ones that it's trying to explain. 

Bond's hypothesis can't be the best explanation of why the students aren't here at 11:15, if there still not there by noon. >>Well that brings us right back to where we started. Why isn't anybody else here? >>Your guess is as good as mine. >>Well, well my guess is everybody else is here, we just can't see or hear them. >>I bet they're laughing at us right now. >>[LAUGH] 

I bet the professor is up there jabbering away right now like he always does. >>[SOUND]. >>Oh, I hope this material is not on the test. >>Congratulations, you proved me wrong. Your guess is not as good as mine. >>How? >>Humans can't become invisible. >>How do you know? >>Have you ever seen it? >>No. They're invisible, that's why I've never seen it. >>Okay, but the laws of physics, don't allow humans to become silent and invisible. >>And dismisses Bob's new hypothesis, because it's not conservative. It conflicts with well-established, prior beliefs in physics. If you start believing that humans can become invisible, you'll have to give up everything you know about how light and matter work. 

Besides if they were here the seats wouldn't be popped up like this. >>Nope, because besides being invisible and silent, these students are also weightless, they don't smell either. 

Okay, so there is no way to tell whether or not there're students here. 

You're catching on. >>But the laws of physics still don't allow people to be weightless, invisible and silent. >>Well, the laws of physics are based on observation. And there is no way these students can be observed at all. The laws of physics can't apply to something that can't be observed or at least students. >>So then nothing could possibly tell whether or not there are students in these chairs. >>Exactly. >>Hey Ed. We're here live with an unidentifiable, unobservable student. What's it like to be unobservable? Okay. Back to you Ed. >>Pretty sweet huh? >>No, it is not sweet. The only reason why your idea isn't falsified is because it's not falsifiable! If you can't prove it then it's useless. I mean, you might as well say there's invisible elephants floating around. [NOISE] 

Ann rejects Bob's new explanation on the grounds that it's not falsifiable. It's compatible with anything that could possibly happen, but that means that it can't explain why one thing happens rather than another. It's completely empty. [NOISE] >>I was just joking. This is a philosophy class after all. Okay, I don't mind jokes. But let's get serious, because it's not helping us with our problem. Why isn't anybody here? >>Speaking of joking, maybe they're all playing a trick on us. Maybe they decided not to show up. [LAUGH] 

Okay, but why would they do that? Is it April Fool's Day? >>No. It's January. >>Oh. Well, then I don't know why they're tricking us. They just are. >>Okay. I can't believe that unless you can tell me why they would be so silly. >>Ann is criticizing Bob's new explanation because it's not deep. It's shallow, because it depends on a principle that is not self-explaining and needs to be explained. I don't know, I guess the professor just decided to cancel class because he didn't feel like teaching today. [SOUND]. >>Maybe, but then other students wouldn't know, so they would be here. >>Unless, he e-mailed the entire class. Then they would know. Did you check your e-mail recently? >>About an hour ago. >>Then maybe he e-mailed us in the past hour. >>I guess. I mean, that would explain why nobody's here. 

Some professors do cancel class at the last minute. But not him. 

He's too strict. I, I've had five classes with him and he's never cancelled class at the last minute. >>If you miss even one class in this course you, you, will, will, fail, fail, fail, fail. >>So, maybe this time it's different. >>Yeah. Maybe the sun didn't rise. Either way it's totally out of character. [SOUND] >>Ann's point is that Bob's new explanation is Ad Hoc. It applies only to the very circumstances that it was invoked to explain, and it doesn't apply to other cases. That means it lacks power and breadth. >>Okay, but, I've got it! Classes must have been cancelled for some reason. What reason? >>maybe it's a holiday. >>Okay, what holiday? >>I, Martin Luther King. That's it. It's Marting Luther King day. >>That would explain it, I mean nobody goes to class but a fool on a holiday. >>Hi, I'm here. >>I guess that makes us both fools >>Yeah, so I guess that's why he didn't send a note, because he figured no one would come here. I bet he wrote it down in the syllabus. It also explains why there's no one's in the whole classroom building. >>Bob's new explanation works because it has all of the virtues that the other explanations lack. >>It's powerful, broad, deep, simple, conservative, and not falsified, and yet, falsifiable. Those virtues make his explanation good or in his words, sweet. >>You're right. You know, I think there's some kind of ceremony today with the president of the college and some big hotshot from Washington. For Martin Luther King Day. So probably that's where the whole class is. That's why they're not there. >>Maybe, but even if there weren't a ceremony, the fact that it's Martin Luther King Day would explain why nobody is here, so you don't really need to add anything else. >>Anne rejects Bob's newest explanation because it's not modest. It commits him to more matters of fact than are needed to explain the observations at hand. >>So I guess the holiday explains it all. >>Well, not really, we still don't know why that big head keeps popping in on the side. >>That's one that I can't figure out myself. >>It's so weird. >>I [INAUDIBLE] used to babysit me when I was younger. >>This whole exchange can be seen as a single argument that takes the form of a long inference to the best explanation. The first premise is an observation. Nobody else is in the room. The second premise is an explanation. The hypothesis that class was cancelled because of the holiday, plus accepted facts and principles, gives a suitably strong explanation of the observation in premise one, namely, the observation that nobody else is in the room. 

Premise three is a comparison. No other hypothesis provides an explanation nearly as good as the holiday hypothesis in premise two. And the conclusion is that the holiday hypothesis in premise two is true. The most controversial premise is probably premise three. It says that no other explanation provides nearly as good an explanation as the holiday hypothesis. 

To justify this premise, we need to compare other possible explanations. And that's exactly what the two students do throughout the skit. 

Their discussion can then be summarized in this background argument that supports premise three. The hypothesis that the other students are late is falsified by the passing of time. The patients in the forecastle were also getting better. The hypothesis that the other students are invisible is not conservative. The hypothesis that the other students are undetectable is not falsifiable. The hypothesis that the other students are playing a joke is not deep. 

The hypothesis that the professor skipped class is not powerful or broad. 

The hypothesis that the other students are at a ceremony is not modest. 

No other hypothesis seems plausible. Therefore no other hypothesis provides an explanation nearly as good as the holiday hypothesis in premise 2. Even if the other explanations are inadequate, the inference of the best explanation fails unless the hypothesis succeeds at explaining why there was nobody else in the room. Premise two claims that the holiday hypothesis does explain why there's nobody else in the room. So we need to analyze why it succeeds, and to do that, we can look at another background argument. The holiday hypothesis explains why nobody else is there. Because, if classes were canceled because of a holiday, then nobody else would be there. That is, nobody else would be in the room at the usual time. 

The holiday hypothesis is also broad, because it explains other actual observations, such as the observation that the whole building is empty. 

The holiday hypothesis is also powerful, because it applies to many separate cases. For example, it explains why students won't be there on future holidays. The holiday hypothesis is falsifiable, because the two students might find out that classes were not cancelled for the holiday. 

The holiday hypothesis is not falsified, because the two students do not actually find out that classes were not cancelled, and similarly for other ways to falsify the hypothesis. 

The hypothesis is also conservative, because it does not conflict with any well-established beliefs. 

The holiday hypothesis is also deep, because it does not depend on any assumptions that need but lack independent explanation. So, the holiday hypothesis explains why nobody else is there, and it's broad, powerful, falsifiable, but not falsified, conservative, deep. Therefore, the holiday hypothesis plus accepted facts and principles, gives a suitably strong explanation of why nobody else is in the room. These two background arguments use a common list of virtues that are usually called explanatory virtues. In general, one explanation is better or stronger than another if it has more of these virtues. When you understand these explanatory virtues, then you've mastered inference to the best explanation. Right? >>Right. >>Now we can go on and look at other kinds of inductive argument. 

[空白]  我们已经学了 通过推论得出最好解释 是归纳式论证 它们是无效的 可以作废的 

尽管如此 它们仍可能是非常有力的 优秀的论证 这可能是你相信他们的结论的有力的原因 好的 这个可能是对的 但是你如何 肯定他们是非常有力的 优秀的论证呢 我们需要一定的标准 来判定什么时候通过推论 来得出最好解释 是一个好的论证 

并且为了理解这些标准 我们将会看另外一个小短片 这是我的学生们 几年前做的 >>现在是上课时间了 [对话] >>哇哦，人呢？ >>我也不知道 >>今天周一啊 不是吗？ >>对啊 一星期的第一天 还记得 周末吗？ >>哦哦哦 周末 [喧闹声] 是啊 我模模糊糊地记得 玩得很开心 现在 又是回来做正事的时候了 

今天周一啊 现在几点了？ >>11点15了 >>恩 难道现在不应该已经 开课了吗？ >>这里 是一个好的解释 的开始 >>这是一个匪夷所思的情况 有待解释 >>对啊 可能我的表快了 最近它给了我 一些麻烦 你看一下你的？ >>噢 我不戴表 我想知道几点的时候就问你嘛 >>好吧 所以我是你指定的报时员？ >>有点儿像吧 但是教室里一般 会有一个钟 那边有一个 >>好了 所以现在我们知道是11点15 >>对的 >>对于任何 通过推论得出最好解释 很必要的一点是 准确认识你想要解释的东西的 在这个情境下 如果时间是11:10而不是 11:15 那么解释 会有所不同 或者就没什么 好解释的了 

所以大家都在哪里？ >>恩 可能其他所有人都迟到了 毕竟 教授确实是都晚几分钟 才出现的 他告诉我他从来 不直接开始上课 因为他不喜欢他一边讲课 一边有学生进来 >>哦 这很恼我 >>所以 可能 他们就是进来晚一些 因为他们 不想在教授开讲之前 无聊地等着 这就是个恶性循环 >>恩 可能这就是了 但是那么有些 学生也该来上课了呀 所以我们 就坐着等等看吧 [钟摆声] 

够了够了！ 

如果大家会来的话 他们现在应该到了 我的意思是 尽管教授会来迟 但是从来没有这么晚过 >>安通过指出新的事实 反驳了鲍勃的解释  这推翻了鲍勃的假设 并不是 所有学生都迟到了 一个好的解释必须和 所有的事实相符 并不仅仅迎合被解释的 特定事件 

鲍勃的假设不能成为 为什么 所有学生在11点15分的时候 不在这里 因为学生们一直到中午都没来 >>这就让我们回到了 最初的问题 为什么其他所有人都没来？ >>我和你一样一头雾水 >>恩 我猜其他所有人 都在这里 我们只不过看不见 听不见他们 >>我打赌他们现在正在 笑我们 >>[笑声] 

我打赌教授现在肯定就在那里 像平常那样叽里咕噜地讲东西 >>[叽里咕噜声] >>噢 我希望他现在讲的不会出现在 试卷上 >>祝贺你 你让我改变了想法 你的猜测不如我的好（我比你知道的好一些） >>为什么！ >>人当然不可能隐身啊 >>你怎么知道 >>你亲眼见过吗？ >>没有 他们隐身了 这就是为什么我 从来没有亲眼见过 >>好吧 但是根据物理的法则 人是不可能变无声并且隐形的！ >>安并不考虑接受鲍勃新的假设 因为这是不切实际的 它与我们所知道的完善的物理法则冲突 如果你要相信人可以隐身的话 你就需要 抛弃你所有的关于 光和物质相互作用的知识 

另外 如果他们在这里的话 这些座位就不会像这样立着了 >>不不不 因为除了变得无声和隐形之外 这些学生 同样是没有重量的 他们 

也是没有气味的 

好吧 所以没有任何方法来说明 究竟有没有学生在这里 

你跟上我的思维了！ >>但是物理法则仍然不 支持人们变得没有重量 隐形以及无声 >>恩 物理法则都是基于观察 但是这里这些学生没有任何方法 可以被观察到啊 物理法则不能应用在一些 不能被观察到的东西上面吧 至少在这里的 学生 是这样的 >>所以完全没法儿确定这些椅子里 究竟有没有学生？ >>就是这样！ >>嗨 艾德 现在这里正直播请到的是 一名无法确认身份的 看不见的学生 被别人看不见的生活是怎样的呢？ 好的 这里的情况就是这样了 好的 艾德 >>听起来很美妙是不是？ >>不 不美妙 你的想法没有被推翻的理由是 它是无法检验的！ 如果你不能证明的话 那么这是无用的 我的意思是 照你的说法 也可以说现在 有隐形的大象在上面漂 [大象声] 

安通过指出鲍勃的解释是无法检验的 来反驳了鲍勃新的解释 它和任何任何其他可能发生的事都相符一致 但是这就表示 这不能解释为什么是这一件事发生 而不是另外一件事发生 这（教室）完全是空的 [音效] >>我就是想开个玩笑 这本来就是一堂哲学课 好吧 我并不介意玩笑 但是我们要认真一些 因为这玩笑并不有助于 解决我们的问题 为什么没有人在这？ >>说道开玩笑 可能大家是在我们身上 搞恶作剧！ 可能他们串通好了不来上课 [笑声] 

好吧 但是他们为什么要这么做呢？ 今天是愚人节吗？ >>不 现在是一月 >>噢 恩 那我不知道为什么他们 要对我们恶作剧 他们就是这么做了 >>好吧 我不能相信是这样的 除非你告诉我 为什么他们这么无聊 >>安在质疑鲍勃的新解释因为 它不够深入 这很浅薄 以为这基于一个 无法自我证明而 需要解释的原则 我不知道 我猜教授就这么 决定了 取消这节课 因为他今天 就不想教课 [吃东西声] >>可能吧 但是另外的学生不可能知道 所以这些人应该在这里 >>除非 他发邮件给全班了 所以大家都会知道 你最近看你的邮箱了吗 >>大概一小时前看的 >>那么可能是在过去的一小时里 他发的邮件 >>我猜 我的意思是 这可以解释为什么没有人 在这里 

一些教授确实在最后关头取消掉 课程 但我们教授可不这样 

他非常的严格 我跟了他五门课 他从来没有在最后关头 取消课过 >>如果你仅仅是错过了一堂课 你 你 也会 挂 挂 挂 挂 挂科  >>所以 可能这一次是不一样的 >>对 可能太阳就不升起了 不管怎么说这都是不合常理的 [音效] >>安的点在于 鲍勃的解释是 一个特设 这仅仅可以应用在特别的情境下 然而这个 情境也有待原因来解释 并且这个 并不适用于其他情况 这就说明 这缺少力度和广度 >>好吧 但是 哦 我知道了！ 如果课被取消了 一定是有特定的 原因的！ 什么原因呢？ >>可能 今天放假! >>好吧 什么假？ >>恩 马丁·路德·金！ 这就是了 今天是 马丁·路德·金日 >>这就可以解释了 只有傻子才在假日来上课呢！ >>嗨 我在这呢 >>我猜这表示我们两个人都是傻瓜 >>对的 所以我猜这是为什么教授没有给大家 留消息 因为他 早知道没有人会来这里 我打赌他肯定把这写在了大纲里 这同样解释了为什么整幢教学楼里 没有一个人 >>鲍勃的新解释说的通 因为 它有 其他的解释 所缺少的优点 >>它是有力的 广泛的 深入的 简单的 符合实际的 没有被推翻 但是 是可以检验的 这些优点是他的解释很优秀或者 用他的话来说 “美妙” >>你是对的 你知道 我认为今天可能有 某种集会仪式 大学的校长和华盛顿的一些名人 会参加 来庆祝 马丁·路德·金日 所以可能大家都去这个集会了 这就是为什么他们都不在这里的原因 >>有可能 但是即使今天没有集会 今天是 马丁·路德·金日 的事实就可以 解释为什么没有人在这里 所以其实 不用再加任何东西 >>安反驳了鲍勃最新的解释 因为那不简洁 他考虑了更多的不需要的事实 来解释当下观察到的状况 >>所以 我猜假期就全解释清楚了 >>恩 并不是全部的 我们还是不知道 为什么 那个大脑袋老是从那一边蹦出来 >>这也是我自己都无法搞清楚的一点！ >>简直太奇怪了 >>I [渐行渐远] 当我很小的时候自己带自己 >>这整个对话可以被视作一个 单个的论证 是通过推论来得出 最好的解释 第一个前提是一个观察结果 没有一个人在教室里 第二个前提是一个解释 由于假期课被取消了 这个假设 附加一些讨论通过的 事实和原则 这强有力地解释了 在前提一中出现的情景 那就是 没有一个人在教室 这个情境 

前提三是一个比较 

没有其他的假设能够比前提二中的 假期假设那样更好地 解释这个情境 所以结论是前提二中的假期假设 是正确的 最值得讨论的是前提应该是 前提三 它说的 没有任何其他的 解释比 假期假设更好地解释 这个情境 

来辩护这些前提 我们需要 来比较这些可能的解释 这正是 这两个学生在小短剧中 从头到尾做的事情 

他们的讨论可以在这个背景讨论中 总结为 支持前提三 其他同学都迟到了 这个假设 由于时间的流逝而被否决 

其他学生都隐身了 这个假设 是不实际的 其他学生是无法让人察觉的 这个假设 是无法验证的 其他学生是在恶作剧 这个假设 并不深入 

教授取消了课 这个假设 并不有力 或者广泛 

其他学生都去集会了 这个假设 并不简洁 

没有其他的假设看起来像是可信的 所以没有任何一个假设像 前提2中的假期假设那样非常好地解释了 这个情境 即使其他的解释是不充分的 最好的解释的推论 也不成立 除非其他的假设成功 解释为什么教室里没有一个人 前提二中假期假说确实 解释了为什么 没有人在教室里 所以我们要分析为什么它成功了 为了做这个 我们可以看一下另外一个 背景论证 假期假设解释了为什么没有人 在那里 因为 如果由于假期课被取消了 那么没有任何人会在那里 就是说 没有任何人会像平常一样 呆在教室里 

假期假设也非常宽泛 因为它解释了 另外一些现象 比如 整幢楼都是空的这个现象 

假期假设同样也很有力 因为它可以应用到很多单独的情况中 比如说 它解释了为什么在以后的假期中 同学们都不会在那 假期假设同样也是可检验的 因为那两个学生也可能 获知课程并没有因为假期而取消 

假期假设没有被推翻 因为两个学生并没有确切找到 课没有被取消 还有 

其他类似的可以把假设推翻的方法 

这个假设同样也是符合实际的 因为它 与任何完善的法则没有冲突 

假期假设也是深入的 因为它并不是 基于 任何需要但是又缺乏解释的假设 所以 假期假设解释了为什么 没有人 在那里 并且它是广泛的 有力的 可检验的 但是有没有推翻的 符合实际的 深入的 因此 假期假设和 讨论通过的事实及原则 给予了 为什么没有人在教室 这个问题 一个非常有力的解释 这两个背景论证用到了一个 有共同优点的列表 通常被称为 解释优点 通常的 一个解释比另一个更好 或者更有力 是因为它有更多的这些优点 当你理解这些解释优点 那么 你就掌握了 通过推论得出最好解释 对吧？ >>对的！ >>现在我们可以继续 想想其他类型的归纳式论证了 

### A Student Example of Inference to the Best Explanation

In the previous lecture we saw one example of inference to the best explanation, but it might help to go through just one more. 
 
I told you, that detectives often inference to the best explanation to figure out who committed the crime. One really neat example of this kind of argument, was provided by some students in the first offering of this course. Just check out the video that they made. >>I think I'm going to go for a run. Phillip and McKenzie are sleeping. 
 
Work up an appetite. I might dig into some of those cookies later. 
 
[SOUND]. That was a good run. I think I'm going to have some cookies. What? 
 
Oh, man. That was a brand-new dish. The dish broke, and I was wondering, if you heard anything or if you have anything to do with it. >>No, I just woke up. >>You didn't hear, huh. I wonder what, how this could have happened. You didn't feel any earthquake, did you, or something? >>Well, I suggest that perhaps it was Timmy. >>Timmy? You know, come to think of it, I'm looking at this counter, and I'm seeing a dump of cat's hair, I think we found our answer. >>Mm-hm. Timmy did it. >>Phillipa. >>Timmy. >>Timmy what do you have to say for yourself? >>Meow. >>Love that video didn't you? Great production values. He's ready for Hollywood. The actors, Emmys. Oh man. And what every hard professionals. 
 
And the argument was good too. 
 
First of all, it was really clear, I mean you know exactly why they think Timmy did it. Structure was really good. 
 
You start with a phenomenon that needs to be explained, namely the dish was broken on the floor. 
 
And you look for alternative explanations, and you compare those different explanations, and the best explanation, is that Timmy did it. 
 
Okay, so what are the competing explanations? Well, McKenzie might of done, but she denied it, she wouldn't lie to her parents, she looks so innocent, at least I thought so. We'll see whether other people agree. 
 
And the other possibility is an earthquake, but nobody felt an earthquake, and they probably would have felt an earthquake, so that's no good. Maybe Philipa did it. Wait a minute. I don't know if you noticed that little box. Phillipa sleeps like a log, and he got back at 7:45. That's when the dish was broke, she didn't come down till 9:45. If she's sleeping like a log, how could she have done it? So we've got different hypotheses that are being considered, and he's looking for the best. So what makes it best is not just that those other hypotheses have things that rule them out. But also that this hypothesis has a lot of positive support for it, one thing that's nice is he found the hair on the counter, that was crucial. Because now the hypothesis that Timmy did it, explains not just the dish, but also the hair on the counter. And that's a sign, of a good explanation. That it explains not just the particular things, but it's powerful, and broad, it applies to other things as well, and explains other phenomenon. that need to be explained. 
 
So, overall eh, I think there's pretty good reason to think that Timmy did it. 
 
And the kicker that proves it all is that the cat confessed. You heard it yourself. The cat said. >>Meow. >>Of course, your argument could be stronger, because inductive strength comes in degrees. But the fact that it could be stronger doesn't mean it's no good. You can get a pretty good reason by ruling out the most plausible hypotheses, even if there are a few that you didn't quite get to in presenting your argument. 
 
And sure enough, in the discussion forums, some students pointed out weaknesses. Which amounted to looking at these different hypotheses as possible explanations of the data. A lot of students seem to suspect McKenzie. Here's one of them. Joe writes, Hi Kevin, while watching the interrogation of McKenzie I got the feeling she was hiding something. She had means, motive and opportunity. I think in order to add to the strength of the inductive argument that she's innocent, she should volunteer for a lie detector test. 
 
And then he goes on, I suspect Timmy was framed. Considering how minorities and the poor are treated in the justice system I recommend he remain silent until he secures representation. 
 
Well, I don't know about the second half of that but, with regard McKenzie, there's an interesting point to be, notice here. 
 
Joe didn't know Mackenzie and he didn't trust her. Thinks she looked suspicious. But Kevin, he knows McKenzie. He lives with her. He spent a lot of time with her and he trusts her. 
 
So we have a nice example of how an inductive argument might be strong for one person and not for the other person. Because Kevin has this background information that McKenzie's trustworthy, whereas Joe does not have that background information. 
 
So the argument that Kevin gave in the very short form in which it occurred, might be good enough for him. 
 
Because of his background knowledge about Mackenzie's worthiness. Course it's not good enough for Joe, because Joe doesn't have that background knowledge. And that's just a fact about inductive arguments in general. That they might be strong for some people, and not so strong for other people. 
 
And we could make the argument even stronger, by looking at other explanations. So what about Phillipa, well she sleeps like a log, but maybe she was sleep walking and knocked the cookies over when she was sleep walking. What about Kevin himself, how come he is getting off the hook. Maybe he did it when he came back from running because he had sweat in his eyes and didn't notice it and didn't hear the plate drop because he was so tired. 
 
Maybe there was a burglar who came in, and while they were stealing things, they knocked the cookies over and that made noise, and so they got scared and ran away. 
 
Maybe it was Santa Claus. He has been known to eat cookies that are left out on the counter for him. 
 
Maybe it was a ghost. 
 
These are all kinds of possible explanations, and you could drive yourself crazy trying to rule out every possible explanation. So to a certain point you have to decide, when is the argument strong enough? And that depends on what you're going to do with it. 
 
Now, I've said I think this is a good argument. 
 
I think Timmy did it. The confession really is the kicker. 
 
But I'm not ready to give Timmy capital punishment. I'm not ready to banish Timmy from the house. 
 
There's some steps that would just be too harsh, in response to this amount of evidence. However, I do think, that the evidence is strong enough, that we can guide our action with it. At least in ways that don't have a lot of cost. 
 
So for example, my suggestion to Kevin and his entire family is, don't put the cookies on the edge of the counter. 
 
I mean, if Timmy's going to knock them off and you don't want them knocked off, you gotta accept some responsibility yourself. 
 
And this argument can be good enough, to guide our action, about where to put the cookies on the counter, when to leave them out. And when not to leave them out. Even if it's not good enough, to justify capital punishment. So one thing that we need to think about in accessing, not just how strong an argument it is, but whether it's strong enough, is what are we going to do with it? And what are the costs incurred if we're wrong. 

在前一讲中 我们看过了一个有关最佳解释推理的例子 这也许对我们看下一个例子有帮助 
 
我说过 侦探常常通过 最佳解释推理来找出真凶 我这里有一个很棒的论证实例 是由第一轮参与这门课的学生提供的 让我们来看看他们制作的视频 —我要出去跑会儿步 现在菲利帕和麦肯锡还在睡觉 
 
希望跑步能让我有食欲 这样过会就可以享用饼干了 
 
[声音] 跑得真爽 现在我想吃饼干了  让我们再试试评分器报错的 
 
喔 天哪 这可是个全新的盘子 盘子碎了 我想知道是谁干的 你有没有听到什么 还是这就是你干的 —不是我 我才刚醒 —你没听到吗 我想知道到底发生了什么 你有感觉到地震或是震动什么的吗？ —其实吧 我觉得罪魁祸首 可能是提米 —提米？ —你们过来看看 我在柜子上找到了什么 一簇猫毛 我想我们八成找到祸首了 —嗯 肯定是提米干的 —菲利帕 —是提米 —提米你还有什么要为自己辩解的吗 —喵 你们一定已经爱上这视频了 多棒的制作品质 他都可以进军好莱坞了 演员们都能得艾美奖 天哪 每个人都那么专业 
 
论证也很棒 
 
首先 它非常清晰 大家都知道他们为什么认为是提米干的 论证结构也很棒 
 
从一个需要解释的现象开始 也即盘子被打碎在地上 
 
接着你寻找不同的解释 并且比较它们 其中最优的解释就是：这是提米干的！ 
 
那么 还有什么别的的解释呢？ 麦肯锡有嫌疑 但她否认了 她不会对爸妈撒谎的 她看起来非常无辜 至少我是这么认为的 等会儿我们来看看其他人是否也这么觉得 
 
还有一个可能就是发生了地震 但没人感觉到 但她们也可能感觉到过地震而没说 因此论证不明确 也许是菲利帕干的 等一下 你们是否注意到刚才有个提示框 “菲利帕睡得很酣” 男主人公是7:45回来的 那是盘子被打碎的时间 但是她到了9:45才下楼 如果她睡得很酣 怎么可能打碎盘子呢 这样我们就有了一些可以参考的假说 而男主人公在从中寻找最佳解释 使最佳解释脱颖而出的原因 不仅仅是因为其它的假说自身有漏洞 也是因为此猜想本身有许多有力的证据作为支持 其一就是他发现了台子上的猫毛 这点很关键 因为假如是提米干的 这就既能解释 盘子碎了 也能解释台子上的毛 这就是一个好的解释的标志 即该解释不仅解释了特定的事件 而且它十分有力和广泛 可以适用于其他事情 还可以解释一些其它现象 
 
综上 我认为有充足的理由认为是提米干的 
 
并且 证实的关键是 猫对此供认不讳 你也听到了 猫说 —喵 当然 你的论证可以更强 因为归纳论证的强度有不同程度 但是它能加强 并不意味着它还不够好 通过排除最合理的那些假说 你完全可以得到一个很好的理由  即使有些被排除的合理假说 你在论证中都没想到过 
 
当然 在讨论区有些同学还是指出了论证的薄弱环节 也即 他们认为这些不同的假说 可以作为对已知情况的可能解释 有很多同学似乎很怀疑麦肯锡 这是其中一个学生的回复 乔写道 嗨 凯文 在观察你审问麦肯锡的时候 我感觉她似乎隐瞒了什么 她既有意图 又具备动机和时机 因此我认为 如果要为“她是无辜的”这一归纳论证增加说服力 她应该主动接受测谎 
 
他继续道 我怀疑提米是被陷害的 想想看少数族裔和穷人在司法体系中是如何被对待的 我建议他保持沉默 直到自己的权益得到保障 
 
这后半段我不太懂 但是关于麦肯锡 有一点很有趣 大家注意一下 
 
乔不认识麦肯锡 他不相信她 并认为她很可疑 但凯文认识麦肯锡 他们一起生活 他们相处多时 他信任她 
 
这样我们就有了一个绝佳的例子表明 一个归纳论证可能对某人的说服力很强 但对另一人则不然 因为凯文拥有背景信息 那就是麦肯锡值得信任 而乔则没有 
 
所以凯文给出的简短的论证 对他而言足以证明麦肯锡的清白 
 
因为他有麦肯锡值得信任的背景知识 但他的论证对乔的说服力不够 因为乔没有这样的背景知识 这就是归纳论证的一个事实 即论证的说服力对某些人来说会很强 对另一些人却又不够 
 
同时我们能通过对其他解释的排查 使论证更强 菲利帕可能仍脱不了干系 的确她睡得很酣 但或许她有梦游 而在梦游中打翻了饼干 还有凯文自己呢 他也有嫌疑 他或许就是在跑步回来的时候打翻的 当时可能他眼睛里进汗水了 因此没看到 又碰巧因为太累了 没留意到盘子摔破的声音 
 
也许是有盗贼闯进来偷东西时 打翻了饼干 发出了声响 然后就被吓跑了 
 
也许是圣诞老人呢 人们一直认为圣诞老人会吃台子上留给他的饼干 
 
说不定是鬼干的 
 
有各种各样可能的解释 为了一个个排除它们你都能把自己逼疯 所以某种程度上你必须决定 何时论证足够强？ 这取决于你准备怎么处理论证的结果 
 
既然我已经说了这是一个很好的论证 
 
我认为是提米干的 它的供认就是破案关键 
 
我可不准备给提米死刑 我也不会从此不让提米进屋了 
 
毕竟只有这点证据 这些措施未免太严酷 然而 我的确认为 证据的说服力已经足够强了 足够我们进行下一步行动了 至少能使我们的行为不会造成太大损失 
 
比如说知识比如说知识 我的给凯文和他的家人的建议是 别把饼干放在台子边上！ 
 
我的意思是 要是提米把饼干打翻 你又不想它们被打翻 你就得自己承担点责任了 
 
这个论证足以用来指导我们的行动 该把饼干放在台子的哪个位置 什么时候摆出来 该什么时候收进去 但是如果要判处死刑 这个论证就还不够完备 所以在评价论证的时候我们要考虑的 不仅是论证有多强 而是它是否足够强 还有我们要如何应对论证得到的结果 以及如果我们错了 会付出多大代价 【教育无边界字幕组】校对：日磾Midi 审核：Reckless-bell 

### Arguments from Analogy

Another very common kind of inductive argument is an argument from analogy. We'll see that these arguments from analogy are very closely related to inferences to the best explanation. But first, we gotta ask, what's an analogy? 
 
Analogy is basically a comparison. between two things. It points out similarities between those two things. And analogies are given all the time. 
 
For example, a poet might say her eyes were like emeralds. 
 
Well, in what way were they like emeralds? They might have had the same color. They might have shimmered like emeralds. They might have been valuable like emeralds. 
 
And the analogy, her eyes were like emeralds, doesn't really tell you exactly which respect her eyes resembled emeralds. That's part of the point. When you're writing poetry, you want to stimulate creative comparisons and analogies of, so that readers of the poem can think about it in their own way. 
 
And the same thing holds for other analogies in other areas. 
 
But the cause is not very specific, some people think that analogies are just no good at all in arguments. 
 
Actually though, we use analogies in arguments all the time. 
 
Here's an example from public policy, they built a transportation system in the city of Houston, Texas it worked pretty well. 
 
And then the planners in the city of Phoenix, Arizona were wondering what kind of public transportation system to build there. And they reasoned like this. They said, Phoenix is a lot like Houston in many ways. 
 
Large population, hot during the summer, many many people. And large area. 
 
So they said, Phoenix resembles Houston in a lot of ways. This type of transportation system worked in Houston, so it'll probably work well in Phoenix, also. 
 
Now, what about law? Lots of legal decisions were based on analogies too, because common law systems at least follow precedent. When judges decide a case one way in one time, at one point, then later on other judges are supposed to make similar decisions. So you can say for example The Supreme Court declared that segregated public high schools are unconstitutional in the United States. 
 
Colleges are a lot like high schools, so segregated public colleges are also unconstitutional in the United States. 
 
And then med schools are a lot like colleges. So segregated public medical schools are also unconstitutional in the United States. And that's the way the legal system evolves by drawing analogies among the different cases that come up within that jurisdiction. 
 
This form of argument in law might seem to be a real problem because you don't say exactly what the similarities are. 
 
But actually, it's very useful. Because it is predictable if you know that segregated high schools have been declared unconstitutional, you pretty much know that judges are going to find colleges unconstitutional too, if they are segregated . And it also gives flexibility, so that judges can see when they're going too far. They say well that precedence's different and they distinguish the precedence. So by resting legal reasoning on arguments from analogy, they gain both predictability and also flexibility in the legal system. So arguments from analogy can be pretty useful. 
 
Fine but policies and laws Are all about norms and values. What about science and hard facts? The science issues analogies too. 
 
For example, scientists at one point didn't know what was at the center of the earth. But they found a bunch of meteors and meteorites, that had a high iron content. 
 
Much higher than the content of iron in the crust of the earth so they reasoned the earth must be like these other meteors and meteorites so they must have a similar amount of iron in it because they were produced in the same way in the history of the universe 
 
but that means there must be a similar amount of iron. In the earth, if it's not in the crust, where could it be? It must be down in the core. So they figured, probably the core of the earth has a lot of iron in it. 
 
That's just one example. But scientists actually use analogies a lot, and if you don't believe me, go read some psychological studies of scientific reasoning. 
 
We're going to focus on an example from art history. 
 
Just imagine that you're going through the attic and you find an old painting. It looks a lot like a painting by the famous impressionist Cezanne. And if it is by Cezanne, it's worth an awful lot. But you've got to figure out Whether this painting is by Cezzane? How do you figure it out, because Cezzane didn't sign it? He didn't sign a lot of his paintings. 
 
Well, what you do is you look at other Cezzane paintings and try to find out whether they're similar. And if you're not an expert, you probably better check with an expert and have them do it. But they're going to do the same thing. They're going to compare this painting to a lot of other paintings that we know are by Cezanne. 
 
And then you can reason like this. This painting has a certain kind of brush work and coloring, and so on and so on. Subject matter, whatever. 
 
other paintings by Cezanne have very similar brush work and color patterns and topic. And so on. 
 
Those other paintings are definitely by Cezanne, we know that, therefore, this painting is probably by Cezanne as well. 
 
Now that's an argument from analogy. 
 
This argument from analogy shares a certain form with the other arguments from analogy that we discussed before, and we can pick out that form By substituting letters for the English words in the English argument. 
 
For example, we can substitute the letter A for the subject, that is the topic of the argument. The painting that we don't know whether it's a Cezanne or not. 
 
And we can substitute the letters B, C, and D, for. The similar objects that are also Cezanne paintings. 
 
And we can substitute the letters P, Q, and R for the similarities between the paintings that we know are by Cezanne and the one that we're not sure of. 
 
And then we can substitute the letter X. For that particular property of being by Cezanne. 
 
And when you substitute all those letters for the English words, then the argument simply says that object A has properties P, Q, and R. And objects B, C, and D also have those properties P, Q, and R. 
 
And B,C, and D also have the property X, so the subject, object A, probably also has the property X, namely this painting is by Cezanne. Probably. Of course since this argument only tries to show that the conclusion is probably true, it's an inductive argument. It's not valid, it's possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. Namely this painting might resemble all those other paintings in those respects and yet it's not by Cezanne. Secondly the argument is defeasible. 
 
You could get some additional information that makes it Really look like a bad argument. For example, you could turn the painting over. And on the back, you find the signature of a different artist, like [INAUDIBLE] 
 
And then you realize, this isn't by Cezanne at all. 
 
But nonetheless, the argument can be strong. It can always be stronger, because there can be more similarities. And more important similarities, but it can be a strong argument and a good argument because it's inductive, so it doesnt even try or pretend to be valid. 
 
How can we tell when an argument from analogy really does give us a strong reason to believe the conclusion. What are the standards by which we measure How strong the argument is and how strong the reasons are. 
 
Well, one of them should be obvious. Of course the premises have to be true and justified, like in any argument. 
 
A standard that's relevant here is that when there are more important analogies, then it provides a stronger reason because some analogies are just totally unimportant, the painting is square, other paintings by Cezzane are square therefore this is by Cezzane. Well that's ridiculous right because lots of painters use square canvases. For something that's important that it's going to be specific to Cezzane and very, very idiosyncratic. Is going to be more important for this type of argument. 
 
Secondly, when they're more analogies. because we don't know exactly which one is the one that's important, that's the point of an argument from an analogy, you draw the analogy without knowing exactly which respect is the crucial one. So the more analogies that you have The more likely you are going to hit on the ones that are crucial. 
 
So if it's not just brush work it's also the type of paint that is used. It's also the color scheme that was used. It's also the geometric shapes. It's also the subject matter. It's a particular mountain that's close by where Cezzane lived. And he painted a lot of that mountain. And on and on and on. The more analogies, the more likely that some of them are going to be the crucial ones and therefore the stronger the argument is and the stronger reason it gives you to believe that this particular painting is by Cezzane. But of course there are always going to be some dis-analogies as well because Cezanne didn't paint the same thing over and over again exactly the way he did the first time. 
 
The fewer dis-analogies the stronger the argument. There'll always be some or there wouldn't be much of an argument there it would be exactly the same painting. 
 
But the fewer dis-analogies, and the less important those dis-analogies are, then the stronger the argument's going to be. 
 
Next, the objects that you're comparing, because they're similar in various respects. That is, the other paintings that we know are by Cezzane. If they're quite diverse then that means that you have similarities among a diverse group, they all share these particular properties and that means that Cezzane continued to use those features throughout all the different types of paintings that he did. And that means that it's going to be a stronger reason to believe that this painting is by Cezzane. Finally, the conclusion is weaker. You could say, therefore, this painting is definitely by Cezzane and it couldn't be anybody else. Well that's kind of crazy, right. But if you say it's probably by Cezzane, it has some chance it's by Cezzane, maybe you want to check it further. Then you're weakening the conclusion and that can make the argument stronger. 
 
So in all of these different ways we can assess how strong the argument from analogy is By looking at the respects in which the objects are analogous, the diversity among the objects that are analogous, the strength of the conclusion, and so on, and so on. 
 
And that is how we access an argument from analogy for strength. I want to close With one more example that raises interesting questions about the relationship between arguments from analogy and inferences to the best explanation. It concerns the pressing issue of whether neanderthals were cannibals. 
 
Now it's not a pressing issue for most people but it is a very pressing issue for people who study neanderthals. And so it's quite a breakthrough when they found some bones in a cave that they knew was inhabited by neanderthals. 
 
In that cave, next to what looked like a firepit. There were bones of deer, with marking of a certain sort. That looked like they had been cutting the meat off the bone. And they also found bones of humans in that cave where they had been cutting, where they had similar markings. And they argued since the bones have similar markings, and these bones, the bones of the deer, were probably cut up for food, well, the human bones were probably also cut up for food. So they reached the conclusion that at least some times Neanderthals ate humans. 
 
What's interesting is that there are two ways to reconstruct this argument. 
 
First, you can reconstruct it as an argument from analogy. 
 
The bones of the humans were found in this location with these kinds of markings. And the bones of deer were also found in this location with these kinds of markings. That the deer were cutup for food, therefore the humans were probably also cutup for food. Now that sounds like an argument from analogy when you think about it that way. 
 
But you can also reconstruct the argument as an inference to the best explanation. 
 
The bones of the humans Had these markings on them and we're in this location. 
 
How do you explain that? 
 
The best explanation of why they have these particular kinds of markings is that they were cut up for food. Therefore. The humans were probably cut up for food as well. Then notice that both reconstructions of the argument make the argument look okay. 
 
And so it's not clear which tells you the real structure of the argument that the author was trying to give. 
 
And that means that arguments from analogy and inferences to the best explanation are actually very closely related. And sometimes you can take an argument and reconstruct it either way. It's not going to affect, very much, how strong the argument is, but it might affect how you see the argument working. 
 
And the big difference is that when you do an argument from analogy, 
 
you don't have to specify exactly which respect is important. So you can point out lots of analogies, and hope that you hit the one that really matters. Whereas when your doing an inference to the best explanation, Then you have to pick out the specific property that gives you the explanation of the phenomenon that you observe. So it forces you to get a little bit more specific than with an argument from analogy. But otherwise, these two arguments are clearly very closely related. And they're basically two different ways to argue. 
 
For similar conclusions. 
 
For example, in this case, with the argument from analogy, you don't know whether it's the location next to the fire, or the types of markings. Or maybe there's several different types of markings, and they're all the same. But you don't know which ones are the ones that indicate how it was killed, and which markings indicate. How it was cut up to be eaten and an argument from analogy can leave all that vague and just think that probably one of those similarities like justify the conclusion that the humans were cut up to be eaten. 
 
But if you're going to give an inference to the best explanation Then, you're saying that these markings. For example, diagonal markings on leg bones, might suggest that they cut that up in a certain way, because that's how they prepared the deer meat, and they were used to preparing deer meat that way. So they used similar cutting techniques when they were preparing human meat. and you've got an explanatory story that's much more specific than a mere analogy, but it also commits you to a lot, so it might be questionable in various ways. 
 
So when you look at an argument like this, you've got to decide which way to reconstruct the argument, as an argument from analogy or as an inference to the best explanation. And the general rule is one that we saw Long ago in early weeks of this course. If you really want to understand an argument, you want to understand your opponents or you want to have a better argument for yourself, then you try to make the argument look as good as possible. 
 
So when you face a particular example like the neanderthal example, you have to decide is this argument be, going to be better if I reconstruct it as an argument from analogy Or is it going to be better if I reconstruct it as an inference to the best explanation and the best reconstruction is going to be the one that makes the argument look best. 

另一种常见的归纳论证是由类比得出的论证 我们可以看出 这些类比论证 与最佳解释推理非常相近 但首先我们要问 什么是类比？ 
 
根本来说 类比是两者之间的比较 根本来说 类比是两者之间的比较 它指出了两事物间的相似点 类比非常常见 类比非常常见 
 
例如 一个诗人可能说 她的眼睛仿佛翡翠 
 
它们哪里像翡翠呢？它们可能有着相同颜色 它们可能像翡翠般闪耀 它们可能如翡翠般珍贵 
 
"她的眼睛像翡翠" 这个类比 并不是真要让你知道 她的眼睛和翡翠的某方面很像 这是其中一点 当你写诗 你想鼓励读者进行创造性的对比和类比 让读者以自己的方式去思考 
 
这点在其它领域的类比中也同样适用 
 
但由于(类比给出的) 原因并不是很明确 有的人认为类比在论证中没有任何好处 
 
但实际上 我们一直都在论证中使用类比 
 
这是一个有关公共政策的例子 德克萨斯的休斯顿市建立起了一个运输系统 那系统运作得非常好 
 
而亚利桑那州凤凰城的规划者正在考虑 应在自己城市建造怎样的公共运输系统 他们这样推理 他们说 凤凰城在很多方面很像休斯顿 
 
人口众多 夏季炎热 有很多很多人 还有广阔的地域 
 
所以他们说 凤凰城在很多方面与休斯顿相像 这种运输系统在休斯顿行得通 那么它很可能在凤凰城也行得通 
 
那么 法律也可以类比吗？ 很多法律决议也是基于类比的 因为普通法法系至少要遵循先例 比如在法官判决时 如果一度采取某种方式处理某个案件 之后的其他法官就应该作出类似的判决 例如最高法院宣布 种族隔离公立高中在美国是违反宪法的 
 
大学跟高中很像 所以种族隔离公立大学在美国也是违反宪法的 
 
然后医学院跟大学很像 所以种族隔离公立医学院 在美国也是违反宪法的 这就是司法体系的发展方式 对管辖范围内不同案例进行类比 
 
在法律中这种形式的论证似乎有问题 因为你并没有指出确切的相似之处 
 
但实际上 它非常有用 因为它是可预测的 如果你知道种族隔离高中已经被宣布为违反宪法 你几乎就知道法官会宣布 种族隔离的大学也是违反宪法的 同时它也提供了灵活性 所以法官可以知道是否偏离太远 法官们会说 然而先例之间也有差别 因此 基于类比论证之上的法律推理 使得法律系统既得到了可预测性 又具有灵活性 所以类比论证可以说非常有用 
 
好的 但是政策和法律都是关于规范和道德标准 那么科学和事实呢？ 科学也使用类比 
 
例如 科学家曾经不知道 地球的中心是怎样的 但是他们发现很多流星和陨石内部富含铁 
 
大大高于地壳的铁含量 于是他们推断地球一定和这些流星和陨石类似 于是他们推断地球一定和这些流星和陨石类似 所以它们内部必定有相近的铁含量 因为它们在宇宙历史上是以相同的方式形成的 
 
意味着铁的含量相近 但如果成分相近的铁不在地壳 那会在哪里呢？ 必定是深在地核 所以它们得出结论 很可能地核含有大量的铁 
 
那只是一个例子 但实际上科学家经常使用类比 如果你不相信 你可以去读一些 关于科学推理的心理学研究 
 
我们再来看一个来自艺术史的例子 
 
设想你正走过一个阁楼 你发现了一幅旧的画作 它看起来很像著名印象派画家塞尚 (Cezanne) 的作品 如果它是塞尚所画 它将价值连城 但是你必须弄清楚这幅画是不是出自塞尚之手 你该怎样去辨别呢？ 因为塞尚没有签上他的名字？ 他大部分作品都没有签名 
 
你可以做的是 参考塞尚其它作品 尝试分辨它们是否类似 如果你不是专家 你最好找个专家来给你鉴定 但是他们也是做同样的事情 他们会将这幅画与许多其他塞尚的已知作品作对比 他们会将这幅画与许多其他塞尚的已知作品作对比 
 
然后你就可以这样推理 这幅画的笔触、着色、主题等等元素 都有一定的风格 
 
塞尚的其他作品 也有非常类似的笔触、着色和主题 等等 
 
我们知道那些画确实是塞尚的 因此 这幅画很可能也是塞尚的 
 
以上就是一个类比论证 
 
这个类比论证 与我们之前讨论的其它类比论证 有同一种形式 我们可以用字母替换论证中的英语单词 来提取形式 
 
例如 我们可以用字母A替换主题 论证的主题 那幅我们不知道是否属于塞尚的画 
 
我们用字母B C和D 替换塞尚的作品 
 
我们用字母P Q和R 替换塞尚已知作品与我们不确定的画之间的相似点 
 
然后我们用字母X 替换塞尚作品的独有特性 
 
当你用字母替换所有英语单词之后 论证就被简化为 对象A有性质P Q和R 对象B C和D也有性质P Q和R 
 
B C和D还有性质X 所以对象A也很可能有性质X 即这幅画是塞尚的 很可能 当然 这个论证只是试图说明结论很可能是真的 它是一个归纳论证 它不是有效的 它有可能前提真而结论假 即这幅画可能在那些方面都与塞尚其他的画相似 但仍然不是塞尚的 第二 这个论证是可辩驳的 
 
你可以加入一些额外的信息 让它看起来真的像一个坏的论证 例如 你可以把画翻过来 在背面 你发现另一个画家的签名 比如"赛让" 比如"赛让" 
 
然后你意识到 这根本不是塞尚的作品 
 
尽管如此 这个论证仍可以是有力的 它总是能变得更有力 因为可能还有更多更重要的相似点 但它也是一个既好又有力的论证 因为它是归纳性的 所以根本不必非去证明它是否有效 
 
那么在类比论证中 怎样才能分辨出一个足矣让我们相信结论的有力理由？ 我们衡量论证和理由有力程度的标准是什么？ 我们衡量论证和理由有力程度的标准是什么？ 
 
其中一点是显而易见的 当然 如同任何一个论证 前提必须是真的并且是合理的 
 
与此相关的一个标准是 如果存在更多重要的类比 那么它就提供了一个更有力的理由 因为有些类比是完全不重要的 比如说 那幅画是方形的 塞尚其他的画也是方形的 因此那幅画是塞尚的 那很荒谬 因为很多画家都用方形的画布 重要的信息应该是针对塞尚的 且非常独有的 是对于这类论证更为重要的 
 
第二 有更多类比的时候 因为我们不确切知道哪个是重要的 这就是类比的关键了 在你进行类比时 并不清楚哪方面才是关键 所以类比越多 你命中关键点的可能性就越大 
 
所以如果不仅仅是画法 还有使用的颜料类型 配色方案 几何形状 主题 塞尚住所附近的某座山 或者他多次描画了这座山 等等 类比越多 其中某些成为类比关键的可能性就越大 因此论证就越有力 理由就越充分 就越能让人们相信 这是塞尚的作品 当然 也总会有反类比的特点 因为塞尚并不一直以第一次的方式 反复地画同样的事物 
 
所以反类比的不同点越少 论证就越有力 不同点总是会有一些的 但它们不会占据论证的大部分 不会说画都一模一样了 
 
但是不同点越少 这些不同点的重要性就越小 论证就越有力 
 
还有 是你所比较的对象 那些已知的塞尚作品 它们在许多方面是相似的 如果它们是非常多样的 那么你得在一个多样的群体里找到相似点 它们都拥有这些特定的性质 即塞尚在他所有不同类型的作品中 持续地展现这些特点 意味着这是一个更有力的理由 让人们相信这幅画是塞尚的 最后 结论比较弱 你可以说 所以 这幅画一定是塞尚的 不可能是别人的 那不太合理 对吧？ 但如果你说 那很可能是塞尚的 有可能是塞尚的 也许你想要进一步确认 这样你就削弱了结论 这使论证更有力 
 
用这些不同的方法 观察类比对象的相似性 观察类比对象的多样性 观察结论的力度 等方面 这样我们可以评价此类比论证的有力度了 
 
这就是我们评价类比论证力度的方式 最后我再举一个例子 这个例子针对类比论证和最佳解释推理间的关系 提出了有趣的问题 它涉及尼安德特人是否同类相食这个紧迫的问题 
 
对大多数人这不是紧迫的问题 但对研究尼安德特人的学者 这是一个非常紧迫的问题 因此学者在尼安德特人生活过的一个山洞发现一些骨头时 那确实是一个突破 
 
在山洞中 紧挨着像火坑的地方 学者发现了鹿的骨头 上面有特殊的痕迹 那看起来像尼安德特人从骨头上切肉所留下的 他们也在山洞中发现了人类的骨头 上面也有类似的痕迹 因为骨头上有相似的痕迹 并且很可能是为吃肉而切鹿骨 所以专家推测 人骨被切很可能也是为了吃肉 所以他们得出结论 至少在有些时候 尼安德特人会吃人 
 
有趣的是 有两种重建这个论证的方法 
 
首先 你可以通过类比重建论证 
 
在这里发现的人类骨头有这种痕迹 在这里发现的鹿骨也有这种痕迹 在这里发现的鹿骨也有这种痕迹 因为鹿是被切作食用的 所以人很可能也被切作食用 当你那样思考时 它听起来就像一个类比论证 
 
但你也可以通过最佳解释推理来重建这个论证 
 
人类遗骨上有这种痕迹 并且是在这个地方被发现 
 
你如何解释？ 
 
对于骨头上特殊痕迹的最佳解释是 它们被切来食用了 所以 这些人很可能也被吃掉了 注意 两种论证重建方式看起来都可以 
 
因此很难确定哪个显示论证的真正结构 哪个是作者试图重建的论证结构 
 
那意味着 类比论证和最佳解释推理 事实上是密切相关的 有时候你可以把论证重建成任一种形式 而不会对论证有力度有很大影响 但可能影响论证的实现形式 
 
一个很大的区别在于 当你进行类比论证时 
 
你不需要具体指出哪方面是重要的 你可以给出很多类比 并希望你命中真正重要的那个 而当你进行最佳解释推理时 你必须具体指出那个特殊的性质 来解释你观察到的现象 来解释你观察到的现象 所以它较类比论证要更具体一点 所以它较类比论证要更具体一点 但除此以外 这两种论证是非常紧密联系的 基本上 它们是对相似结论的两种不同论证方式 
 
基本上 它们是对相似结论的两种不同论证方式 
 
例如在这个例子中 类比论证时 你不知道究竟是靠近火的地方 还是痕迹种类更关键 可能有不同种类的痕迹但看起来完全一样 你不知道哪个表明了动物被杀的方式 哪个痕迹表明了它们被切作食物的方式 一个类比论证 可以将这些都模糊化 而只考虑其中一个相似点 很可能证明人被切来食用的结论 
 
但如果你要给出最佳解释推理 那你说的就是  这些痕迹 例如腿骨上的对角线划痕 可能表明他们是以某种方式切割的 因为那是他们处理鹿肉的方式 他们习惯以那种方式处理鹿肉 因此他们处理人肉时 也使用类似的切割方法 这样你就得到了一个解释说法 它要比单纯的类比更具体 但你也得承担更多问题 它可能在其它各方面还有疑点 
 
因此当你面对这样一个论证 你必须选择以哪种方式重建论证 以类比论证 或者以最佳解释推理 像我们在课程前几周看到的 一个普遍规则是 如果你真地想理解一个论证 想了解你的反对者 或者想得到一个对你自己有利的论证 你就要尝试构建一个尽可能好的论证 
 
因此当你面对一个特定的例子 像尼安德特人的例子 你必须决定 是以类比论证来重建 还是以最佳解释推理来重建 才能够得到一个更好的论证 最好的重建方式 是能使论证看起来最好的那个 【果壳教育无边界字幕组】校对：aPRIltenYY 审核：Reckless-bell
