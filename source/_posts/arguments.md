Think Again: How to Reason and Argue
Reasoning is important. This series of four short courses will teach you how to do it well. You will learn simple but vital rules to follow in thinking about any topic at all and common and tempting mistakes to avoid in reasoning. We will discuss how to identify, analyze, and evaluate arguments by other people (including politicians, used car salesmen, and teachers) and how to construct arguments of your own in order to help you decide what to believe or what to do. These skills will be useful in dealing with whatever matters most to you.

Courses at a Glance:
All four courses in this series are offered through sessions which run every four weeks. We suggest sticking to the weekly schedule to the best of your ability. If for whatever reason you fall behind, feel free to re-enroll in the next session.We also suggest that you start each course close to the beginning of a month in order to increase the number of peers in the discussion forums who are working on the same material as you are. While each course can be taken independently, we suggest you take the four courses in order.

Course 1 - Think Again I: How to Understand Arguments
Course 2 - Think Again II: How to Reason Deductively
Course 3 - Think Again III: How to Reason Inductively
Course 4 - Think Again IV: How to Avoid Fallacies

About This Course in the Series:
When is someone giving an argument instead of just yelling? Which parts of what they say contribute to the argument? Why are they arguing instead of fighting? What are arguments made of? What forms do they take? Think Again: How to Understand Arguments will answer these questions a more. 

In this course, you will learn what an argument is. The definition of argument will enable students to identify when speakers are giving arguments and when they are not. Next, we will learn how to break an argument into its essential parts, how to put them in order to reveal their connections, and how to fill in gaps in an argument. By the end of this course, students will be better able to understand and appreciate arguments that they and other people present.

Suggested Readings:
Students who want more detailed explanations or additional exercises or who want to explore these topics in more depth should consult Understanding Arguments: An Introduction to Informal Logic, Ninth Edition, Concise, Chapters 1-5, by Walter Sinnott-Armstrong and Robert Fogelin.

Course Format:
Each week will be divided into multiple video segments that can be viewed separately or in groups. There will be short ungraded quizzes after each segment (to check comprehension) and a longer graded quiz at the end of the course.


# HOW TO UNDERSTAND ARGUMENTS

CONTENT: In this week's material we will teach you how to identify arguments as opposed to abuse . We will define what an argument is, distinguish various purposes for which arguments are given (including persuasion, justification, and explanation), and discuss the material out of which arguments are made (language). The last three lectures this week are optional, but they are recommended for advanced students. LEARNING OUTCOMES: By the end of this week’s material, you will be able to :
define what an argument is
pull arguments out of larger texts
distinguish various purposes of arguments

## Welcome to the Course

###  intruduction to the course


Hi, I'm Walter Sinnott-Armstrong from Duke University. And I'm Ram Neta from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Three years ago, Ram and I constructed a Coursera course called Think Again. It taught students how to analyze and evaluate arguments. >> It taught them how to tell the difference between good reasoning and bad reasoning. 

Over the last three years we've had a wonderful time teaching Think Again and we've really enjoyed interacting in the discussion forums with students from all over the world. We were extremely pleased with the reaction to our course. Over the past three years over 750,000 students enrolled in that course. 

But we realized that we could teach the course even more effectively if we made a few small changes. 

First, it wasn't easy to cover all the material that we wanted to cover in the 12 weeks of our course. Each week contained hours of lecture, exercises, and quizzes. And doing all those hours of work every week for 12 weeks was a tall order. 

In the third week of each section of that old course we asked you to learn new material and then also take a quiz. Well that's just too much. 

So for these reasons, we decided that the best way for students to learn all of the material that we wanted to teach them was to divide up our original course into four much shorter courses. 

That way, you can take one of the courses. Take off a month or two, take another course. Maybe skip a course, we hope you won't. But do it with your own pace in a way that fits your lifestyle best. 

In that way, you're most likely to end up learning all of the material that we want you to learn. Maybe not this year, but eventually. 

And the material really does fit together. So even though we've split up the course into four separate courses, it's very worthwhile for you to take all the different courses if you possibly can. The lectures in the mini course that you're about to take now, 

were all part of our original 12-week course. 

And so frequently, you're going to find that we make references in those lectures to other features of that original 12-week course. 

For example, very early on, I say that arguments have a form or a structure, and that we'll study that form or structure in future weeks in the course. Well now that's in the second course, the course on Deductive Logic. 

And I begin the course in Deductive Logic by saying, Welcome to Unit 2 of our course. Well, I was referring to Unit 2 of our original 12-week course. 

But now Deductive Logic is its own course and when I talk about Weeks 4 and 5, I'm referring to Weeks 4 and 5 of our original 12-week course, but now they're Weeks 1 and 2 of the Deductive Logic course. We hope this is not too confusing, but the basic message is really simple. Just ignore all of those cross references to other parts and courses or other courses. Just the same way that you ignore the wrinkles on an old road map. Hey! I like to use wrinkled roadmaps. Well it's fine to use wrinkled roadmaps as long as you know the wrinkles aren't extra roads because then you're going to drive off onto them! So you're saying that the students can learn all the material that we want to teach them, even if they ignore all of our references to the old 12-week course? >> Exactly. >> Sounds like a plan to me. >> We hope that you enjoy taking this mini course just as we enjoyed making it. >> And we hope that it encourages you to take the other courses in our Think Again sequence. >> And also to encourage your friends and family to take this series of courses as well, because it's a lot more fun to take these courses together with other people so that you can talk to them about the arguments you'll be studying. 

Thank you for listening.

###  course logistic

Welcome to Think Again: How to Understand Arguments! This course is the first in a series of four courses titled Think Again: How to Reason and Argue. We are excited that you are taking this course, and we hope that you will stick around for all four courses in the series, because there is a great deal of important material to learn.

In the series as a whole, you will learn how to analyze and evaluate arguments and how to avoid common mistakes in reasoning. These important skills will be useful to you in deciding what to believe and what to do in all areas of your life.

The first course in the series focuses on how to identify arguments. When is someone giving an argument instead of just yelling? Which parts of what they say contribute to the argument? Why are they arguing instead of fighting? What are arguments made of? What forms do they take? Think Again: How to Understand Arguments will answer all of these questions and more.

This course will contain lectures, ungraded exercises, and one final quiz that will count towards the certificate, if you choose.

LECTURES: Each week will consist of a set of modules that will contain a series of short lectures along with practice quizzes. The topics are described in the syllabus on the course website and at the beginning of each week.

PRACTICE QUIZZES: The point of the practice quizzes is only to make sure that you understand the material in the corresponding lecture. They are not intended to be difficult. If you miss too many questions in the practice quizzes and if you do not understand the explanations of the answers that we provide, then it might be a good idea to listen again to the relevant lecture before proceeding to the next lecture. All of these practice quizzes are ungraded and optional, but we hope that they will help you learn more. If you have trouble with any question in the practice quizzes, then you should post your questions on the discussion forums. If you do not have trouble, please go into the discussion forums and help your fellow students with their questions. The best way to learn is to teach. In the previous runs of this course, many students were extremely good at helping other students. We and our teaching assistants will also check the forums occasionally in order to provide additional assistance.

FINAL QUIZ: The final quiz at the end of the course will contain questions similar to the practice quizzes. You may take the quiz as many times as you want in order to pass, with different questions each time. You will be able to retake the quiz three times every eight hours. We will provide explanations of all of the answers in each quiz so that you can check those explanations before trying the quiz again.

TEXTBOOK: We suggest that you obtain and read the recommended textbook: Understanding Arguments, Ninth Edition, Concise Version, by Walter Sinnott-Armstrong and Robert Fogelin. Chapters 1-5 are relevant to this first course. This textbook is not required in order to do well in this course or the other courses in this series, but it will probably help you by providing more examples, exercises, and explanations. You can buy a paperback or electronic copy here, if you like:

Link to buy Understanding Arguments, Ninth Edition, Concise Version

WORKLOAD: For each weeks of material, you should expect to spend on average roughly 2 hours watching the lectures, another 2 hours doing the practices quizzes, another hour per week reading the textbook (which is optional), and about 1 hour each time you take the final quiz. Some students spend more time, and some spend less. The amount of time you spend is entirely up to you. The more time you spend, the more you will learn.

FORUMS: The best way to learn about arguments is to practice constructing your own arguments and analyzing arguments given by other people, especially people with whom you disagree. We provide opportunities for such exchanges in the discussion forums, which are also places to find answers to your questions, new examples, and stimulating discussions of various issues with fellow students from around the world.

Special Discussion Forums can also be used to set up study groups, give feedback on course material, seek help with technical difficulties, and tell us and other students about yourself. Please be polite when using these forums. You will be able to vote up or down posts in these forums so that the most useful posts will rise to the top and be seen first.

EMAIL POLICY: Please do NOT email the professors. Unfortunately, it will not be possible for us respond. We wish we could, but there are simply too many students for us to be able to reply to individual emails. Thanks for understanding.

SPREAD THE WORD: You will get more out of this course if you share the adventure, so we suggest that you encourage your friends, relatives, neighbors, or colleagues to take the course with you.

We hope that you are looking forward to the course. We are.

Let’s get going!

## How to Spot an Argument

###  why arguments matters

[BLANK_AUDIO]. Hi. Welcome to our Coursera course. This is the first time we've ever taught an online course, and we're very excited about it. >> All right! [LAUGH]. >> I'm Walter Sinnott-Armstrong from Duke University. And my co-teacher is Ram Neta from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Say hi, Ram. >> Hi. >> Thanks. This is going to be a great course. It's going to cover a lot of important practical issues, raise some fascinating theoretical questions. We'll also try to have some fun, because there're lots of wacky examples where people make silly mistakes and arguments in everyday life. And we'll try to teach you how to avoid those. The title of the course is Think Again. How to reason and argue. And the title pretty much tells you what the course is about. We'll try to teach you to think again about a wide range of issues that effect your life in various ways. We're not going to try to convert you to our point of view or, or teach you to believe what we believe. Instead, we want you to think in a new way and in a deeper way about the issues that matter to you most. 

The subtitle of the course, How to Reason and Argue, tells you that we're going to focus on a particular type of thinking, namely reasoning, because most people don't want to be arbitrary or have unjustified beliefs. They want to have reasons for what they think and do. But how do you get reasons? Well, we're going to approach reasons by way of arguments, because arguments are just ways to express reasons. 

And if you can understand arguments, you can understand reasons. And if you can formulate good arguments, you can have good reasons for the ways in which you think and behave. 

So that's one way in which it's important to understand arguments, namely to get better reasons for your own beliefs and actions. But, another way in which it's very important to understand arguments, is to avoid mistakes. because there's lots of charlatans out there who are going to try to convince you to think the way they want you to think and to behave the way they want you to behave by giving you bad arguments. So you need to spot them and avoid them. Just think about a used car salesman who tries to convince you to buy a, a car, because it looks really cool and you'll look even cooler if you're sitting in the car. Well, that might be a good reason to buy a car and it might not. And you're going to have to figure out which kinds of arguments to believe and which kinds not to believe. 

Consider another example, say a lawyer in a courtroom, and you're sitting in the jury, and they're going to try to convince you either to find the defendant guilty or to find the defendant not guilty, but either way, you don't want your decision to be like flipping a coin. You want to have reasons for what you're thinking. And for the verdict that you reach. as a member of the jury. Or, an evangelist tries to convert you to their religious beliefs and to get you to give up your old religious beliefs. Well, you don't want to make that kind of a decision arbitrarily either because it's so important. And then what about your personal life. You might have a friend who says let's go for a cross-country trip. It'll be great. Well, maybe it will and maybe it won't. But you don't want to commit yourself to such a big endeavor without having thought it through properly. How are we going to study arguments. Well, in this course we'll have four parts. The first part, we'll teach you how to analyze arguments. That might seem really simple, you just read the passage and hear what they're saying. But actually it's quite hard because some passages or some sets of words, if we're talking about spoken language, contain arguments and others don't. Here's an example. Consider a letter to the editor. Some letters to the editor don't have arguments at all. They just say, thank people for having behaved in nice ways or done nice things. 

On the other hand, other letters to the editor include arguments. They try to convince you. To vote for a certain political candidate for example. So you need to distinguish which passages include arguments and which passages don't include arguments. Then, you need to look at those passages and figure out which of the words, which parts of those passages contain the argument. Then you need to separate out those parts, put them in a certain order, which we'll call standard form. And, often these arguments will have missing parts and you'll have to supply those missing parts or suppressed premises in order to get a full picture of how the argument works. And that's what we'll do in part one. Then in part two, once we've got the argument in shape, we can start to evaluate it. But evaluations are going to depend a lot on what the purpose of the argument is. 

Some arguments try to be valid in a logical way [SOUND] and those are deductive arguments. So we'll start first by looking at deductive arguments and the formal structure of deductive arguments. We'll look at propositional logic, then categorical logic. That'll be part two of the course. Then in part three, we'll look at a different kind of argument, inductive arguments that don't even try to be deductively valid. 

Here there are just a lot of different kinds. So we'll look at statistical generalizations, applying generalizations down to particular cases. We'll look at inference to the best explanation and arguments from analogy. We'll look at causal reasoning and probability and decision making. So it'll be a lot of different types of inductive arguments covered in part three. 

Then in part four, we'll look at fallacies. These are common. The very tempting ways to make mistakes in arguments. Some of them have to do with vaugeness. Others have to do with ambiguity. Some of them are irrelevance, like arguments ad hominem and appeals to ignorance and we'll also look at a major fallacy called begging the question that people commit all the time. And in the end, we'll teach you a general method for spotting and avoiding these common mistakes. So that'll be part four. And at the end of each part, we'll have a short quiz with some questions to make sure you understood. So we're very glad to have you in this course, and we're very honored that there's so many students in this course. But that raises one problem. Namely, we cannot answer emails from students. So please do not email us individually. 

There will be discussion forums where you can go and talk to other students about the material in the course. And I bet that if you go to those forums, not only will you get your questions answered, but if you go to those forums and help answer other people's questions, everybody will learn more and that's what this course is all about. So, thanks very much for joining us on this adventure and we hope you stick with it because we've got a lot of fun and a lot of important things to cover. One final recommendation. We've done these lectures so that you can just watch the lectures by themselves and do the exercises and take the quizzes. However, if you're listening to a lecture and you're having a little trouble understanding it, or if you're really fascinated and you want to get more detail, then there is an accompanying textbook called, Understanding Arguments. 

by myself and Robert Fogelin. Many, many, many of the best ideas in this course come from him, he's been a leader in this field of understanding arguments for many decades and I owe awful lot to him and I really appreciate that. So, I want to do a little shout out to thanks to Robert Fogelin before we get started on this course and the next lecture. 

[BLANK_AUDIO] 大家好 欢迎参与Coursera的课程 这是我们的第一个在线课程 教授的课程 我们对此感到十分兴奋 太棒了！ — 哈哈 我是杜克大学的Walter Sinnott-Armstrong 我的合作老师是来自北卡罗来纳州大学教堂山分校的Ram Neta 和大家打个招呼 Ram 大家好 谢谢 这将会是一门了不起的课程 我们将会涵盖很多重要的实际问题 实践问题 提出一些有趣的理论问题 我们也会尝试来些乐子 因为这里有 人们在日常生活中争辩时 会犯下的许多愚蠢的错误 我们将会试着教你如何避免这类事情发生 这门课程的名字是《重新思考：如何推理与论证》 标题已经明确解释了这门课程的内容 我们将会教你如何重新思考 在生活中各种各样影响着你的问题 我们并不会试图改变你的观点 或让你相信我们的理论 相反 我们希望你可以用一种新的 并且更深入的方法去思考与你生活密切相关的问题 

课程的副标题 如何推理与论证 告诉你我们如何会专注于 一个特定类型的思考 即推理 因为大部分的 人都不想成为武断的人或者持有未经证明正确的看法 他们希望在思考与行动时都是有道理的 但是你要怎样做到推论呢 我们会用论证的方法的得到理由 因为论据是仅有的方式来陈述理由 

如果你能明白论据 那么你就会明白原由 并且如果你可以组织很好的论证 有很好的理由为你思考和行为的方式服务 

所以这是我们需要理解论证的重要原因之一 也就是为我们的思考与行动找到更好的理由 但是另一个我们需要理解论证的 重要原因是避免错误 因为有很多江湖骗子们 会试图说服你相信他们的理论 并通过一个糟糕的理论让你 做出愚蠢的选择 所以你需要发现并避免他们 试想一下一个二手车推销员 试图说服你买一辆二手车 因为它看起来很酷 如果你开这辆车会变得更酷 这可能是一个好的理由买下这辆车 也可能不是 所以你需要分辨哪些理由 是可以相信的，而哪些不是 

试想一下另一个例子 如果你是陪审团 而一个律师试图说服你 被告人有罪或者无罪 无论哪一种情况 你都不想做出像抛硬币那样的决定 你希望你的想法是有逻辑性的 并且作为陪审团的一员 做出合理的判决 或者一个传教者尝试改变你的宗教信仰 让你放弃原来的宗教信仰 你不会希望随意地做出这样选择 因为这很重要 还有你的私人生活 你可能有朋友邀请你参加越野旅行 这可能很棒。额，也许不是。 但是在没有好好考虑过之前 你最好不要答应如此重大的活动 我们将如何学习论证？ 我们的课程会有四个部分 第一个部分 我们会教你如何分析论证 这看起来很简单 你只要阅读文章并听他们在说什么 但是这其实很困难 因为有些段落或者词组 举一个例子 有论证而有些没有 举个例子 假设在写一封信 有些人写的信完全没有论证 

它们只是 对人们做的事情表示感谢 相反 另一些信件会有论证 它们会试图说服你 比如给某一位政党候选人投票 所以你需要区分哪一些段落 有论证而哪一些没有 接下来 你需要找出 段落的哪一些词汇 句子含有论证 然后你把它们分开 并且排序成我们所说的标准形式 这些论证经常会缺少一部分 所以你需要提供这些缺少的部分 或者有暗示的前提 从而得到论证的全貌 这是我们第一部分将会学到的东西 接着在第二部分 

当我们得到论证的框架 我们可以开始进行评断 [声音] 论证的目的 有些论证是有逻辑性的 这些是演绎论证 我们首先会学习 演绎论证和它的正式结构 我们会了解命题逻辑 然后是范畴逻辑 这将会是课程的第二个部分 

在第三部分我们会了解一种不同的论证方法 归纳论证 并不能演绎有效 它们有很多种 所以我们会参照这些数据的统计概括 把这些归纳结果应用到特定案例中 我们将用类推法推理出 

最好的解释与类比论证 我们会学到因果推理 概率与决策 所以在第三部分我们会学到许多 不同种类的归纳论证 在第四个部分我们会讨论到谬论 它们很常见 容易让人在论证中犯错误 有些是含糊不清 而有些有歧义 还有一些是和论证完全无关的 比如人身攻击或诉诸无知 我们还会讨论一个人们经常会犯的谬论 假设性的推断 最后我们会教你 识别并避免这些错误的方法 最后我们会教你 识别并避免这些错误的方法 这将会是第四部分 在每个部分的最后我们会有测验 

确保你已经理解了本单元的内容 在每个部分的最后我们会有测验 确保你已经理解了本单元的内容 我们很高兴你的加入 很荣幸这门课有这么多同学 我们很高兴你的加入 很荣幸这门课有这么多同学 但是这产生了一个问题 就是我们不可能回复每一个学生的邮件 所以请不要单独给我们发邮件 我们会有论坛 在那里你可以与其他的同学 讨论课程里的内容 如果你参加这些论坛 不仅你的问题会得到答复 而且在论坛里 你也可以帮助其他同学回答问题 

所有人都会从这门课程中学到很多东西 这也是课程的宝贵之处 非常感谢你加入这门课程 也希望你可以坚持到最后 因为我们会有很多的乐趣 

### what is an argument

Well I hope the first lecture convinced you that arguments really matter. Of course, they're not the only things that matters, there's more to life than reason and arguments. but they are something that matters and they matter a lot. So, we need to understand arguments. Now, the first step in understanding arguments is to figure out what arguments are. And the first step in understanding what arguments are is to figure out what arguments are not. Because we want to distinguish arguments from all of those things that don't count as arguing. And the best source of information about what arguments are not, is, of course, Monty Python. Well, that was pretty silly wasn't it? But in the midst of all that silliness we find some truth because after all, many members of the Monty Python troupe were philosophy majors. So each room represents a kind of thing that we need to distinguish from arguments. [INAUDIBLE] So let's think first about getting hit on the head lessons. [NOISE] . Arguments are not like hitting people on the head, you hit poeple on the head when you wrestle. [NOISE]. The point is that arguments are not fights you don't win an argument by hitting somebody on the head. Sometimes little children say that their parents are arguing, when they're really having a verbal fight. >>All this fighting I might as well be back with my parents. Dammit George, I told you if you didn't quit drinking I'd leave you. Well, I guess that makes you a liar because I'm drunk as hell and you're still here. >> But you can not win an argument just by yelling at someone. 

That doesn't make the argument any better because that's not the point of arguing. Another room in the Monty Python skit involves abuse. >> Don't give me that you snotty-faced heap of parrot droppings. >> Now abuse is one of the things you do with language, but it's not the same as arguing. You cannot win an argument simply by calling your opponent a stupid git. >> Stupid git. >> And the point of this course is not to teach you to go back and abuse your roommate by calling them nasty names. That will not help you win any argument. It also won't help you win any friends. And another room in the skit has to do with complaining. >> [INAUDIBLE]. >> But all those complaints don't amount to an argument either. They're just expressing your emotion about the situation. Arguing is something different from all of those rooms. So what is arguing? Well, at one point one of the character says. >> Well argument is not the same as contradiction. >>Can be. >> No, it can't. >> So what do they mean by a contradiction? In British English to say a contradiction is just to deny the person or contradict what they said. but contradicting what the person said, that is denying it, is not arguing. I can say, what do you think the best flavor of ice cream in the world? Well I have my favorite. I know what the best flavor is. The best flavor is Ben and Jerry's Coconut Almond Fudge Chip ice cream, There's nothing better. And then you say, no it isn't. Well you haven't argued that it isn't and I haven't argued that it is, we're just disagreeing with each other. We haven't given any reason for any of the positions that we've adopted yet. So, as Monty Python says later on, in different character, argument is an intellectual process. It's a process not just of asserting your views, but of giving some kind of reason for your views. 

So the next definition that Monty Python gives of an argument, is that an argument is a connected series of statements to establish a proposition. I take it they mean intended to establish a certain proposition. So that's a pretty cool definition, if you think about it, because it tells you what an argument is made of. It's a series of statements, and statements are made in language, so arguments are made of language. It also tells you what the purpose of argument is. The purpose of argument, they say, is to establish a certain proposition. So now we have a pretty unique definition of argument. 

This definition gives us a nice contrast. Because there are lots of other series of statements or sentences that don't count as arguments because they're not intended to establish a proposition. Consider for example a novel, which has statements about what's going on, but it's not necessarily trying to establish any particular proposition. Or a dictionary might have a series of definitions, but it's not intended to establish a certain proposition. Instead, novels and dictionaries order sentences in a different way. They order them either chronologically or alphabetically whereas, arguments are trying to put statements into a certain structure that reflects the order of reasoning in order to establish the proposition according to Monty Python. But Monty Python, no matter how great they are, and they are great, didn't get it quite right because the purpose of an argument is not always to establish a proposition because some propositions that are conclusions of arguments, we already knew. 

Consider for example a mathematical proof. 

If someone tries to prove the Pythagorean theorem in geometry. People already believe the theorem. 

They already knew that it was true. So they weren't trying to establish the proposition. But the proof does something else, it shows you how that proposition is connected to the axioms of the system. It helps you understand why the proposition is true. And, we'll see that other arguments, like explanations, do the same thing. So sometimes arguments are intended to establish a proposition, like Monty Python said, but in other cases they're intended to help us understand the proposition and the reasons why the proposition is true. So we want to distinguish reasons to believe that the proposition is true, from reasons why the proposition is true. and arguments can do both of those things. So, we need a somewhat broader definition of argument to cover these different kinds of reasons. 

We'll think of an argument as a connected series of sentences or statements or propositions, where some of these sentences or statements or propositions or premises and one of them is the conclusion and the one's that are premises are intended to provide some kind of reason for the one that's the conclusion. This definition is useful in many ways. First of all, it tells us what the parts of the arguments are, the premises and the conclusion. Secondly, it tells you what the argument's made of. It's made up of language because sentences and statements and propositions are made in language. 

Third, it tells you the purpose of argument, to give a reason for the conclusion. 

Fourth, a nice feature is that it's very flexible because there are lots of different kinds of reasons. We don't want our definition to be too narrow because then it won't cover all the different kinds of arguments, and the notion of reason captures the different kinds of relations between the premises and the conclusion in different kinds of arguments. 

So let's do a few quick exercises to make sure that you understand how this definition works. 

### what are arguments used for? justification!

Welcome back. In the previous lecture, we saw a definition of argument as a connected series of sentences, statements or propositions. Where some of those sentences, statements, propositions are premises and one of them is a conclusion. And the premises are intended to give some kind of reason for the conclusion. In this lecture we're going to look at the purposes for, which people give arguments because the purposes are crucial in determining what an object is. Take for example an artifact that you might find in an archeological site. You won't be able to figure out whether it's a really big screwdriver or a really small spatula unless you know whether the people who used it intended it to screw screws or to pick up food that they were cooking. 

So, to understand arguments we need to understand the purposes for arguments. And that means, why does somebody bother to give an argument instead of just asserting the conclusion without an argument? Well, just think about it. If you went to a used car lot and the salesman said, you ought to buy that Mustang. 

Would that convince you? Not a chance. But if the salesman said you ought to buy that Mustang because it looks really cool and it goes really fast. Or maybe it has great gas mileage or whatever, and gives you a series of reasons, then you might be convinced to buy the Mustang. So, that's one purpose of arguments to try to convince you to do things or believe things that you wouldn't otherwise do or believe. So, this purpose is persuading or convincing. And if you think about it what the salesman's trying to do is he's trying to change your mental states. He's trying to make you believe something that you didn't believe or do something that you didn't do. So he's trying to bring about an effect in the world. 

But that's just one purpose of arguments. We don't always act like salesmen. Sometimes, instead of trying to change people's beliefs, we're simply trying to give them a reason for their belief or for our belief. 

And to give them a reason is not necessarily to convince them or persuade them or change their beliefs. 

When we're simply trying to give them a reason to believe the conclusion we're going to call that justification. So, imagine that your friend, you're not a salesman, you're a friend, imagine that your friend is thinking about buying a car. He doesn't know which one to buy. You might say. Well, I think you ought to buy the Mustang. Because it looks really good and it goes really fast and its actually got pretty good gas mileage and its quiet reliable or whatever. 

You're not necessarily trying to convince her to buy that car. It'd be fine with you if she bought any car she wanted, any car that would make her happy. You're trying to talk about the reasons for buying the car so that you can make your own decision. And that says you're trying to justify that decision or that belief that Mustang is the best car for her to buy. 

And not necessarily to convince her or persuade her, if she comes up with great reason to the contrary you're perfect happy. Whereas the salesman wouldn't be. 

But notice, that you might give exactly the same reasons that the salesman did. Exactly the same argument that the salesman did. The difference lies in the purpose because the salesman is trying to convince her to change her beliefs and actions, but your goal with your friend is to discuss the reasons for her decision or action. So, you're thinking about justification and the salesman was thinking about persuasion. Now, it really matters whether your goal is justification or persuasion because there's a big difference here. 

If you're trying to justify your friend's belief or your friend's action. Then you try to give her good reasons, the salesman can convince her or persuade her with bad reasons. So, it doesn't matter to his purposes whether the arguments that he gives are any good or bad, as long as they work to affect that change in the world. Whereas you care about whether your arguments and your reasons are good reasons or arguments because, you're trying to justify that belief or that action. 

And ,of course, people can try to do all of these things at once. They can mix them together in various ways. And that can get complicated. So, when someone gives you an argument, you need to ask a series of questions. The first thing you need to ask is, is this person trying to change my mind? Or change my behavior? If so, then their goal is persuasion or to convince you. 

Then you need to ask, are they trying to give reasons to change my mind? Or for believing, if I already believed it. Well, if they're doing that then their goal is justification. And if you go down that series of questions you'll be able to understand what the purpose of giving the argument is, at least for this range of cases. So, let's do a few exercises just to make sure that you understand justification before we go on to the next purpose of argument, which will be explanation. 

欢迎回来 在上一讲中 我们了解了论证的定义 即一系列连贯的句子 陈述和命题 在这些句子、陈述和命题中 一些是前提 有一个是结论 前提试图给结论一些像样的理由 在这一讲中 我们将要了解 人们给出论证的意图何在 因为这些意图对于决定目标是什么至关重要 比如说你在考古现场发现的一件文物 你搞不清楚它到底是一个很大的螺丝刀 还是一个小铲子 除非你知道当时用它的人 是拿它拧螺丝还是盛起他们烧的吃的 

因此 我们要了解论证的意图才能真的理解论证 这也能解释 为什么有些人会不厌其烦地给出论证过程 而不是不加论证直接抛出结论？ 想想看 如果你来到一个二手车市场 销售员告诉你该买辆野马牌汽车 

能说服你吗？ 这绝不可能 但如果销售员接着对你说 买那辆野马 是因为它看起来很潮 而且速度也很快 或者是油耗低 随便是什么 给你一些理由 也许你就会被说服选择买野马汽车 所以 论证的意图之一就是 试图说服你去做或是相信某些 原来你根本就不会做 或者不会相信的事 因此 (论证的) 意图就是说服你 让你相信 想想看 销售员做的就是 试图改变你的想法 他试图让你相信或者去做某些 你以前并不相信也不会去做的事 所以他想做的 是造成一些改变或影响 

但这仅仅是论证的目的之一 仅仅知道基因组序列 总是表现得像个销售员一样 有时 不是我们想改变人们的观念 而是试图为他人和自己的观念找到理由 

给人们提供一个理由未必是 要说服他们 或者改变他们的观念 

当我们仅仅是提供一个理由 让他们能相信结论时 我们把这个过程称为辩护 (justification) 所以设想 你的朋友 你不是销售员 你的朋友打算买辆车 但他不知道该买哪种 你也许会说 噢 我觉得你应该买野马牌 因为它们外形不错速度很快 油耗又低又很可靠之类的 

你未必是要说服他买这个车 她买什么车和你关系不大 只要她自己觉得满意就行 你试图说的是买车的理由 这样你就可以做你自己的决定 也就是说 你在试图辩护或证明 买野马牌是她选购汽车最棒的决定或者信念 

也未必是要说服她 如果她也有绝佳的理由反驳你 你也还是挺高兴 虽然销售员不会这样 

但注意到 你给的理由和销售员给的一模一样 完全就是销售员所做的论证 区别只在于目的 因为销售员试图说服她改变想法和行为 但你只希望和你的朋友讨论她做决定或行为的理由 所以你只是想辩护 而销售员则是想说服 你的目的是证明还是说服 十分重要 因为这里面区别可大了 

如果你是想证明你朋友的想法 或行为 你就得给她好的理由 销售员能用坏的理由说服她 这对他的意图而言无关紧要 不论他给出的论证严密还是糟糕 只要它们到底起到了作用就行 然而 你在乎的是你的论证和理由够不够好 因为你想要证明 某个念头或行为是合理的 

当然 这些事人们也能一起做到 用各种不同的方式把它们糅合到一起 这也可能变得很复杂 所以 有人给你一个论证的时候 你需要提一系列的问题 首先要问的就是 这个人是不是打算改变我的想法？ 或是我的举止？如果是这样 那么他们的目的就是说服我 

接着你要问 他们是不是给出了能使我改变主意的理由？ 或是我的信念 如果我已经相信了的话 那么这样他们的目标就是辩护 如果你接受这样问下去 你就能理解给出论证的意图 至少对这一类的情形是如此 所以在我们接触论证的的下一个目的：“解释”之前 我们先做一些练习 确定你们已经理解了证明 

### strong arguments don't always persuade everyone


Hi again. In a previous offering of this course, one student made a great point about persuasion and justification and the relation between those two. She did it in an argument that she presented for the entire class and I think we can all learn by listening to her. So here it is. Strong arguments don't always persuade everyone by Jessica Hyde from the United Kingdom. 

It's not enough for an argument to be strong, valid and sound to be persuasive. You can have an argument for which every premise is genuinely true, and where every conceivable flaw in the argument is negated and still, not have it be persuasive. 

There will almost always be someone who either misunderstands the argument, or blindly believes the opposite of a premise, in face of facts. Human beings aren't always logical and don't always believe scientifically proven cause and effect. Religious and cultural beliefs can be too hard to overcome. 

So even the best arguments can have disbelievers. 

Thank you, Jessica. What a great argument. I'm convinced. Remember, to persuade someone is to convince them or change their mind into believing what you wanted them to believe, and what you were trying to get them to believe. Whereas justifying, is giving them a reason to believe your conclusion. 

And those are different. Because, as Jessica argues very well, sometimes people make mistakes. You give a perfectly good argument with perfectly good premises and it's formulated as clearly as could ever be expected. And yet, they don't understand it, or they don't believe your premises. And so they're not persuaded. But still you did give a good argument. So you succeeded in justifying your belief, but was it a good argument if you were trying to persuade them? Well maybe not. If your purpose was to persuade them then It might matter to you that you didn't persuade them. Whereas, if your purpose was to justify the conclusion, to give a reason to believe it, then you did succeed, in that purpose. So, whether you see it as a good argument or not, is going to depend a lot, on what your purpose is. As Jessica points out, sometimes you're going to want to persuade, and it's not always going to be easy to turn an argument that justifies and gives a good reason into one that persuades. That is going to depend on making sure that they do accept your premises, and that they do understand your arguments. And that's yet another trick that we haven't discussed perhaps as much as we should have. And, we learn another lesson from one of the student comments on Jessica's argument. Here it is, from Judith, I think Jessica has opened a very interesting discussion with her argument. Thank you Jessica, I appreciate that, we do too. 

When I'm learning, is the purpose of an argument is to state with clarity, and some degree of certainty, an opinion or point of view; a valid, strong and sound argument in it of itself may never persuade or convert anyone to adopt a different way of thinking. So what. What a strong argument does is communicate clearly what one thinks and why they think it. So I guess the benchmark of success for many arguments is not complete persuasion, but is how clearly one is understood. If someone's intent is to blindly refute everything, that's not an intellectually honest engagement. I've found that in construction better, more thoughtful arguments people may not agree with me, but they're far more considerate of what I have to say. And by using much of what we're learning, I'm listening much more intently to other views. Yes, Jessica, many things do defy logic. We just keep trying to do our best. Thank you Judith. What a great point. Because what you've done is you've shown us that there are other goals of arguments in addition to persuasion and justification. One you mentioned was understanding. Sometimes the point of an argument is not to bring other people over to your point of view. 

But just to make them understand why you hold the position that you do. You're trying to show them your reasons even if you know that those reasons are not reasons that they, themselves, are going to accept. 

Well, why would you want to do that? 

As you say Because it makes them more considerate of what you believe and of you. Because if we understand each other and the reasons why we hold our positions, we'll respect each other more and be more considerate. Not always. Of course there are going to be exceptions. But as a general trend, we're going to get along with each other much better if we understand why we disagree and what reasons we have. 

The example where this is not working is politics. Everybody knows that politicians just yell at each other and don't really listen to each other. They just scream out what's going to appeal to their base without thinking about what the real reasons are for the positions they're holding. 

I think they'd be a lot better off, and we'd be a lot better off, if they were to take Judith's lesson and say, give us the reason so we can understand why you're adopting that position. We'll give you our reasons so you can understand why we're adopting our position. And then we can seek a compromise by satisfying the values that we both are most concerned about. And arguments can play a role then, in helping us cooperate with each other and live with each other and compromise on the very important issues that we all face. Another lesson that Jessica and Judith have taught us, is don't set your sights too high. 

If your goal is to persuade everybody, you're going to be constantly frustrated. Because there's always going to be people out there who, don't understand your argument. Or who, understand it, but are obstinate, and refuse to accept your premise, no matter how well you argue for it. 

So, if you try to convince everybody, you're not going to succeed. 

So give it up. You can't convince or persuade everyone. Still you can accomplish a lot. You can help them understand you,you can come to understand them and you can give them good reasons to believe your conclusion. Well, that's a lot, and that can be very important, even if they're not persuaded. And you, if you're justified to believing your conclusion can have reason to believe that the fault lies with them, not with you, when they don't accept your conclusion. 

Course you probably can't convince them of that. You can't convince them that the fault lies with them, not with you. But still, you might have accomplished your goals if your goals are reasonable. Namely, to increase understanding, to find the reasons for your belief, and to present those reasons and ways that people ought to understand and accept. 

That's what justification is and that's what understanding is, and those can be extremely valuable in arguments even if there's still some people out there who aren't persuaded. 

### what else are arguments used for? explanation

帮助我们翻译！

As I said in the first lecture, arguments are used for many purposes. And in the lecture just before this one, we saw that it can be used for persuasion and also for justification of various sorts. 

But persuasion and justification are not the only purposes for which arguments are given. Arguments are also given in order to explain things. So we're going to spend this lecture talking about explanation. Indeed, what we're going to try to do is to explain explanation. 

We explain things all the time and I may give an example that'll probably really tick off my co-teacher Ram because he's from Chapel Hill, but my example is somebody might ask why did the Duke basketball team win the National Championship in 2010. The answer might be, they had great players and a great coach and of course, they got lucky. you have to have some luck to win a National Championship. But in any case, an explanation of that event is a reason why it happened. so to explain something is to give a reason why it happened or to answer a question about why it happened. 

Notice that when you explain something, you assume that it's true. It wouldn't make any sense to ask why did Duke win the National Championship in 2011, because they didn't. You can only ask why this thing happened if it happened. So we've already got one difference between explanation and justification and persuasion. When you try to persuade someone to believe something. That thing doesn't have to be true, and they don't have to of believed it in advance. When you justify something, right? You can justify belief in something that they don't already believe. 

But when you explain something, both the arguer and the audience are assuming that, that thing happened, that the conclusion is true, and they're looking for the reasons why it happened. 

So if the goal of explanation is not to persuade or to justify and the arguer and the, and the audience both already believe the conclusion then what's the point? What's the goal of explanation? The goal of explanation is to increase understanding, not to convince us that the conclusion is true, but to help us understand why it's true. 

And we can do that in a number of different ways. There're actually, according to Aristotle, four different types of causes, he would call them. But we would probably call them explanations. The first, were, he called efficient causation. We'll just call it causal explanation. And that tells you why something happened. Why did the bridge collapse? Because there was an earthquake. That explains why the bridge collapsed. 

The second type of explanation, he called teleological, or purposeful explanation, because it's looking at the purpose or the telos, or the goal, 

why did Joe go to the grocery store? To buy milk. His goal of buying milk is what explains why he went to the grocery store. Third type of explanation is formal. Why does this peg not fit into this hole? And the answer is, because the peg is square and the hole is round. That's why it doesn't fit in the hole and that explains it, that helps you understand why it didn't fit. The fourth kind of explanation is material. Why is this golf club so light? Why does it weigh so little? The answer might be because it's made out of graphite. That helps you understand why the weight is so low on this golf club. it would be a lot heavier if it were made out of steel. 

So we get four different types of explanation. We can have causal. We can have teleological. We can have formal and we can have material. And all of those different types of explanation are aimed at helping us to understand why something happened. [SOUND] 

So did you hear that train whistle? We want to ask, why does the train emit such a loud noise? Well one answer might be, that what causes it to make that noise is that the conductor pull a lever on the train, which creates that noise. That would be a causal explanation. 

Another explanation might be the teleological explanation. The train was crossing an intersection with cars, and wanted the cars to know that they're coming. 

Another explanation might be a formal explanation, because the whistle on the top of the train has a certain shape that makes the air come out with a certain vibration. And a final explanation might be a material explanation, because air has a certain density and a certain material that makes it create that kind of sound. So we can give all four types of explanations for the same event. 

Here's another example. We can apply all four types of explanation to a single event. Joe jumped out of an airplane. That's what caused him to fall. But then, why did he jump out of the airplane to get excitement? Why did he fall so fast? Because of his shape, it was aerodynamic, and because of the material that he was made out of, heavy flesh, which was a lot denser than the surrounding air. So all four of those factors go into an explanation of why Joe fell when he jumped out of the airplane. 

So next we need to talk about the forms of explanation. You can actually give explanations in, in several different forms. For example if somebody said, oh, why did you move to Duke? I might tell a story about things that happened before I moved to Duke that led me to want to move to Duke and I could talk about moving to Duke and, and all the nice people here and so on. You can give explanations in the form of narratives like that. But notice that, that's not going to imply that everybody in similar circumstances is going to behave in exactly the same way so you're not going to get general principles out of those type of narrative explanations. In other explanations are given in the forms of arguments and that's the kind we're going to be interested in here. The form in which explanations occur in arguments is really pretty simple. One premise usually states some kind of general principle that can apply to a lot of different situations. And then the second premise talks about the current situation and says that those types of features that the principle mentions are instantiated in this case. And then the conclusions says that explains why it happened this way, in this case. 

For example. If we want to know why objects fall, right? So there's a book. And it [SOUND] falls. We want to explain that. We need to cite a general principle. But notice that not all objects fall. Some objects actually rise. Helium balloons rise. So we need a principle that's going to explain why some objects fall and other objects rise. Then we'll understand why helium balloons rise, just to stick with that example. And the answer is that, when an object is suspended freely in a medium, where the medium is more dense than the object, then it rises. And when an object is suspended freely in a medium, where the object is more dense than the medium, then it falls. So you can explain why helium balloons rise by having as your first premise, whenever an object is sus, freely suspended in a medium, like a gas or a liquid. And the medium is more dense than the object, then the object rises. Now let's talk about the circumstances in this particular case. The helium balloon is less dense than the air that surrounds it, therefore, the helium balloon rises. And that explains why the helium balloon rises. And you can see how you give another argument to explain why the book fell. Now, this form of argument gives some people the impression that any generalization could be used for explanation, but that's not quite right. What example is Bode's law? Bode's law says that 0.4 plus 0.3 times 2 to the n can be used to predict all the distances between planets and the sun, where n is the number of the planet. So if n is Venus, then n is 0. Earth is 1, Mars is 2, and so on. this law was actually used to predict both the largest asteroid in the asteroid belt, Ceres, and also Uranus. So, this law is a generalization that held for all the planets that they knew in Bode's day and also used to predict new observations of planets. Pretty cool! It, it actually turns out to fail when you get to other planets. In, including Neptune and Pluto. But, still, it worked pretty well for the data that they had. But, nobody thought that this law explained why the planets were that far from the sun. They happen to fall in that pattern. It could be used to predict. But it didn't explain why they were, the distance that they actually were, from the sun. 

So Bode's law, is an example, where you can get a prediction, without explanation. Now let's look at the reverse. And example where you have explanation. Without prediction. Just imagine that a woman is HIV positive, and she get's pregnant and has a baby, and the baby is also HIV positive. How can the kid become HIV positive? Well the explanation is that the mother was HIV positive and they were sharing blood. But notice that you can not predict from the fact that the mother is HIV positive that the child will be HIV positive because less than half of the children born to mothers who are HIV positive are themselves HIV positive. You also cannot use the fact that the mother is HIV positive, to justify the claim that the child is HIV positive. If you want to know whether the child's HIV positive, you need to check its blood. 

So in this example, we have an explanation of why the child is HIV positive when it is, but we don't get any prediction that it will be HIV positive and we don't justify the belief that the child is HIV positive. So you can have explanation without prediction and without justification. So then more positively, what is the goal of explanation? Well the goal of explanation is to fit this particular phenomenon into a general pattern, and that's what all of these explanations do. Why do you want to fit them into a general pattern? It's simply to increase your understanding. Of why they came about. They came about because they fit into this particular type of pattern. And this kind of understanding of fitting them into a well known pattern is useful, because most of the things that we want to explain are kind of weird, unusual, bewildering, suprising phenomenon. That's when you need an explanation, because fitting into the pattern makes it a little less bewildering, a little less surprising, because it shows that it's kind of like other things that have happened before, and that's what Bode's law does not do. Because Bode's law, although it holds for all the planets that have been observed in the day of Bode. It doesn't explain anything else, it doesn't fit into a larger pattern with other planets around other solar systems. And now that we've discovered planets, we found many planets around other stars that don't seem to follow Bode's law at all. So it doesn't fit our solar system into a general pattern, and that's why even though it's a generalization, and was used to predict other planets, it does not provide an explanation of why the planets are certain distances from the sun. So now we've learned a little bit about what explanation is, and what explanation is not. Explanation is, an attempt to fit a particular phenomenon into a general pattern in order to increase our understanding of why it happened and to remove bewilderment or surprise. Explanation is not persuasion, or justification, or generalization, or prediction. Those are other uses of argument. So we've seen quite a variety of different uses of argument, but we've only scratched the surface. There can be lots more and lots more to say about each of these, so if you want to learn more about these purposes of argument, a good place to start would be chapter one of the accompanying text, Understanding Arguments. We're going to leave this topic for now and turn to a separate topic. In order to understand something you want to know not just it's purpose, but the material out of which it's made. So the next few lectures will be about the material out of which argument are made namely, language. 


正如我在第一节课中所说的 论证有很多目的 在之前的一课 我们了解到它有说服 以及各种辩护的作用 

但说服和辩护 不是论证的唯一作用 论证还可以解释事情 所以我们将用这节课的时间来谈谈解释 事实上，我们将要做的是解释“解释” 

我们无时无刻不在解释事情 我可以举个例子 尽管可能惹恼来自Chapel Hill的同事Ram 我的例子是 有人或许会问 为什么杜克大学篮球队赢得了2010年国家锦标赛冠军 答案可以是 他们有伟大的选手和教练 当然，他们运气很好 赢得冠军必须要些运气 But in any case, an explanation of that event is a reason why it happened. 对这个任意事件的解释 就是为什么它发生了 so to explain something is to give a reason why 所以 去解释事情即 给出它发生的原因或者回答它为什么会发生 

注意到 当你解释某个事情时 你假定它为真 问杜克大学 为什么赢了2011年的国家锦标赛冠军是毫无意义的 因为他们没有赢 只有事情发生了 你才能问它为什么发生了 所以我们已经了解到 解释　辩护和说服的一个区别 When you try to persuade someone to believe something. 当你设法要说服某人相信某事时 那件事不一定就是真的 并且 他人不需要提前相信它是真的 When you justify something, 当你为某事辩护的时候 对吗？ You can justify belief in something that they don't already believe. 你可以为他人还未相信的事辩护 

But when you explain something, both the 但是当你解释某事的时候 arguer and the audience are assuming that, that 论证者和听众都假定了那件事发生了 thing happened, that the conclusion is true, and 结论是是正确的 他们要找出它发生的原因 

So if the goal of explanation is not to persuade or to justify and the 所以 如果解释的目的不是说服 arguer and the, and the audience both 或者为论证者辩护 并且听众已经相信了结论 already believe the conclusion then what's the point? 那么 重点是什么 What's the goal of explanation? 解释的目的是什么 The goal of explanation is to increase understanding, not to 解释的目的是增加理解程度 不是为了使我们相信结论是正确的　而是帮我们理解为什么是正确的 

And we can do that in a number of different ways. 我们可以用许多方法做解释 根据Aristotle的学说 共有四因 他会这么称呼它 But we would probably call them explanations. 但我们将称它们为解释 第一 were, he called efficient causation. We'll just call it causal explanation. 他称为动力因 我们就叫因果性解释 它告诉你为什么事情会发生　为什么桥塌了？ Because there was an earthquake. That explains why the bridge collapsed. 因为发生了一场地震 这解释了为什么桥塌了 

第二类解释 他称为目的论　或者说目的性解释 because it's looking at the purpose or the telos, or the goal, 因为它关注动机或目的 

为什么Joe去了杂货店？ 因为要去买牛奶 买牛奶这个目的解释了为什么他去了杂货店 Third type of explanation is 第三种解释是形式性解释 为什么这个棍子不能对上这个洞？ And the answer is, because the peg is square and the hole is round. 答案是 因为棍子是方的而洞是圆的 That's why it doesn't fit in the hole and that 这就是为什么它不能对上这个洞 这帮助你理解为什么它对不上那个洞 The fourth kind of explanation is material. 第四种解释是质料性解释 Why is this golf club so light? Why does it weigh so little? 为什么高尔夫球杆这么轻 为什么它的质量这么小 The answer might be because it's made out of graphite. 答案可以是因为它由石墨构成 That helps you understand why the weight is so low on this golf club. 这帮助了你理解为什么高尔夫球杆的重量很小 it would be a lot heavier if it were made out of steel. 如果由钢构成 它将会重很多 

So we get four different types of explanation. 这样我们了解了解释的四种类型 We can have causal. 我们有因果性解释 目的性解释 We can have formal and we can have material. 我们有形式性和质料性的解释 And all of those different types of explanation are 这些不同的解释的目的 aimed at helping us to understand why something happened. 是帮助我们理解为什么事情发生了 [声音] 

So did you hear that train whistle? 你们听到了列车的汽笛声了吗 我们想要问的是 为什么列车发出这样大的响声？ 一个可能的答案是 造成它发出那样的响声 is that the conductor pull a lever on the train, which creates that noise. 是列车长拉动了列车上的控制杆 制造了这样的声音 That would be a causal explanation. 这便是一个因果性解释 

另一个解释可以是目的性解释 The train was crossing an intersection with cars, 列车正在穿过与有汽车通行的十字路口 它想要汽车知道列车来了 

另一种解释可以是形式性解释 因为列车顶部的汽笛 train has a certain shape that makes the air come out with a certain vibration. 有特定的构造 使空气以固定的方式震动 And a final explanation might be a material explanation, because air has 最后的解释是质料性解释 因为空气特定的密度和材质　使得它发出那样的响声 So we can give all four types of explanations for the same event. 所以我们可以给同一件事四种不同类型的解释 

来看另一个例子下面再举另一个例子 We can apply all four types of explanation to a single event. 我们可以将四种不同类型的解释应用于一件事 Joe jumped out of an airplane. Joe从飞机上跳了下来 这是造成他下落的原因 但为什么他飞机上跳下来 去获取刺激感吗？ Why did he fall so fast? 为什么他下落的那么快 Because of his shape, it was aerodynamic, and because 因为他的形状 是流线型的 of the material that he was made out of, heavy 还因为构成他的材质 血肉之躯 flesh, which was a lot denser than the surrounding air. 比周围的空气密度大得多 所以四种因素共同解释了 当他从飞机上跳了下来　为什么他会坠落 

So next we need to talk about the forms of explanation. 那么接下来我们讲讲解释的形式 You can actually give explanations in, in several different forms. 事实上你可以在很多种形式下给出解释 For example if somebody said, oh, why did you move to Duke? 例如 如果有人问 为什么你转到了杜克大学 我可以讲一个故事 about things that happened before I moved to Duke 关于在我转到杜克大学之前发生的事 that led me to want to move to Duke 那些事使我想转到杜克大学 and I could talk about moving to Duke and, and all the nice people here and so on. 我可以讲讲转到了杜克遇见了许多很好的人 诸如此类 You can give explanations in the form of narratives like that. 你可以在第一人称叙述的形式下给出解释 But notice that, that's not going to imply that 但要注意的是 这并非暗示了 everybody in similar circumstances is going to behave in 人人都在相似的环境里 每个人都会做出一样的反应 get general principles out of those type of narrative explanations. 所以你无法从这种叙述的解释重得到普遍原理 还有些解释在论证的形式下给出 and that's the kind we're going to be interested in here. 这将是我们感兴趣的类型 The form in which explanations occur in arguments is really pretty simple. 解释在论证下出现的形式十分简单 One premise usually states some kind of general principle 一个前提通常阐明了一个普遍原理 that can apply to a lot of different situations. 那个原理可以应用于许多不同的情况 And then the second premise talks about the current situation 接着第二个前提阐述了当前的情况 并且说明原理中提及的那些特征 are instantiated in this case. 也表现在这件事里 And then the conclusions says that explains 然后给出这件事 why it happened this way, in this case. 为什么这样 发生了的解释 

例如 If we want to know why objects fall, right? 如果我们想要知道为什么东西下落 So there's a book. 这有本书 这个你在什么地方需要论述详细点 使观众听得更明白 又或许哪些地方你说得过多了  [声音] falls. We want to explain that. 下落 我们想要解释这件事 We need to cite a general principle. 我们需要引用一个普遍原理 但要注意的是并不是所有的物体都下落　事实上有些物体上升 Helium balloons rise. 氦气球上升 So we need a principle that's going to explain 所以我们需要一个原理解释 why some objects fall and other objects rise. 为什么有些物体下落 另一些物体上升 然后我们就会理解为什么氦气球上升　继续讲那个例子 答案就是 when an object is suspended freely in a medium, where 当一个物体被自由悬置在介质中 the medium is more dense than the object, then it rises. 介质的密度比物体的大 物体就会上升 And when an object is suspended freely in a medium, where 当物体被自由悬置在介质中 the object is more dense than the medium, then it falls. 物体的密度比介质的大 物体就会下落 So you can explain why helium balloons rise by having 你可以解释氦气球的上升 通过 as your first premise, whenever an object is sus, freely suspended 引述第一个前提： 当物体自由悬置在 in a medium, like a gas or a liquid. 介质中 例如气体或液体 并且介质的密度比物体大 物体就会上升 Now let's talk about the circumstances in this particular case. 接着讲下这件特定的事发生的环境： The helium balloon is less dense than the 氦气球的密度比周围的空气小 air that surrounds it, therefore, the helium balloon rises. 因此 氦气球上升 And that explains why the helium balloon rises. 这便解释了为什么氦气球上升 And you can see how you give another 你可以理解怎么给出另一个论证 argument to explain why the book fell. 去解释为什么书下落 Now, this form of argument gives some people the impression that 这种论证的形式给一些人的印象是 任何归纳都可以用于解释　但这并不对 举个波得定律的例子怎么样？波得定律说明0.4+0.3*2^N to the n can be used to predict all the distances between planets and 可以用于预测所有行星到太阳间的距离 the sun, where n is the number of the planet. 其中 N代表了行星的序号 So if n is Venus, then n is 0. 所以如果是金星 那么N即为0 Earth is 1, Mars is 2, and so on. 地球是1 火星是2 以此类推 this law was actually used to predict both the 这个定则的确用于预测 largest asteroid in the asteroid belt, Ceres, and also Uranus. 小行星带上最大的小行星：谷神星 也预测了天王星 So, this law is a generalization that held for 这个定则归纳了 在波得的那个时代所有已知行星 also used to predict new observations of planets. 并用于预言行星新的观测 Pretty cool! 十分酷 It, it actually turns out to fail when you get to other planets. 事实上它在预测其他行星的时候失败了 In, including Neptune and Pluto. 包括海王星与冥王星 But, still, it worked pretty well for the data that they had. 但它仍然在其它数据上做的很好 But, nobody thought that this law explained why 但是没有人认为这个定则解释了为什么 the planets were that far from the sun. 行星与太阳有那样的距离 They happen to fall in that pattern. It could be used to predict. 它们偶然构成了这样的模式 这可以用于预测 But it didn't explain why they were, the 但并不能解释为什么它们所运行的位置 distance that they actually were, from the sun. 与太阳有那样的距离 

So Bode's law, is an example, where you can get a prediction, without explanation. 波得定则 是你可以拥有预测但没有解释的例子 Now let's look at the reverse. 现在我们来看看相反的情况 And example where you have explanation. Without prediction. 一个你有解释但没有预测的例子 Just imagine that a woman is HIV positive, 想象有一个HIV呈阳性的女性 and she get's pregnant and has a baby, and the baby is also HIV 然后她怀孕了并生下了小孩 小孩也呈阳性 小孩是怎么变成HIV阳性的呢？ 解释就是母亲是HIV阳性 was HIV positive and they were sharing blood. 而她们共用血液 But notice that you can not predict from the 但是注意你无法通过母亲是HIV阳性的事实 预测小孩将会是HIV阳性 因为HIV阳性的母亲生下的小孩之中 are HIV positive are themselves HIV positive. 少于一半的小孩也是HIV阳性 你也不能用母亲是HIV阳性这个事实 positive, to justify the claim that the child is HIV positive. 来为小孩是HIV阳性的宣称辩护 If you want to know whether the child's HIV positive, you need to check its blood. 如果你想知道是否孩子是HIV阳性 你需要检测血液 

So in this example, we have an explanation of why 所以在这个例子中 我们有了当孩子是HIV阳性的时候 the child is HIV positive when it is, but we don't 为什么孩子是HIV阳性的解释 但我们没有任何办法预测它将会是HIV阳性 we don't justify the belief that the child is HIV positive. 我们也无法为相信孩子是HIV阳性的想法辩护 所以你可以有解释的同时 没有预测和辩护 So then more positively, what is the goal of explanation? 那么 什么是解释的目的 Well the goal of explanation is to fit this particular phenomenon 解释的目的是把特定现象 放入一个普遍的模式中　这是所有的解释都做的事情 Why do you want to fit them into a general pattern? 为什么你想要将它们放入普遍的模式 这只是为了增加你的理解 Of why they came about. 关于为什么它们发生了 They came about because they fit into this particular type of pattern. 它们发生了因为它们属于这种特定的模式 And this kind of understanding of fitting them into a well known 理解它们属于一个广为人知的模式 是很有用的 因为大多数我们想要解释的事情是 kind of weird, unusual, bewildering, suprising phenomenon. 古怪的 不寻常的 令人迷惑的 令人惊讶的现象 这也是你需要一个解释的时候 pattern makes it a little less bewildering, a little less surprising, 因为将其放入一个模式 使它变得不那么迷惑 不那么令人惊讶 because it shows that it's kind of like other things that 因为这展示了它与过去发生的事情相似 have happened before, and that's what Bode's law does not do. 这是波得定则所没有做的 Because Bode's law, 因为波得定则 although it holds for all the planets that have been observed in the day of Bode. 尽管它在波得的时代符合了所有行星的观察 它没有解释其它任何事 它不属于更大的模式 a larger pattern with other planets around other solar systems. 比如在其它星系的其它行星的模式 And now that we've discovered planets, we found many planets around 在探索的行星中 我们已经发现了 许多围绕着其它恒星的行星完全不遵守波得定律 所以它无法将我们的太阳系放入一个模式中 pattern, and that's why even though it's a generalization, and 而那正是为什么尽管它是一个归纳 可以用于预测其它行星 它依然无法提供 explanation of why the planets are certain distances from the sun. 为什么行星与太阳有着特定的距离的解释 So now we've learned a little bit about 所以我们学习了 what explanation is, and what explanation is not. 什么是解释 以及 什么不是解释 解释就是 为了增加我们对事情发生的理解 pattern in order to increase our understanding of why it happened and 将特定的现象归入普遍的模式的尝试 to remove bewilderment or surprise. Explanation is not 它消除了困惑与惊讶 解释并不是 persuasion, or justification, or generalization, or prediction. 说服 辩护 归纳 或预测 Those are other uses of argument. 它们是论证的其它用法 So we've seen quite a variety of different 我们看到了论证许多不同的用法 uses of argument, but we've only scratched the surface. 但我们仅仅入了门 There can be lots more and lots more to say about each 关于这些 还有许多许多事情可以讨论 所以如果你希望学得更多一点 of argument, a good place to start would 关于论证的用法 一个很好的开始 是课本 Understanding Arguments 的第一章 We're going to leave this topic for now and turn to a separate topic. 我们将要离开这个话题 进入另一个话题 In order to understand something you want to know not just 为了理解一些你不仅想要知道其目的 it's purpose, but the material out of which it's made. 而且要知道其构成成分（？） So the next few lectures will be about the 那么下面几个讲座将会是关于 论证的构成成分 即语言  

### what are arguments made of? language


Last time we discussed what arguments are for, their purposes. We saw that arguments have at least three purposes. Namely, persuasion, justification, and explanation. We also saw that one way to explain something is to cite its purpose. So we can understand why Joe went to the store by seeing that he went to the store because he wanted some milk. So his purpose was to get milk. Similarly, we can understand arguments by looking at their purposes. And that's what we did last time. But this time we're looking at a different kind of explanation. And as we saw, one way to explain things is to look at the material. So you want to understand why a MacBook Air is so light? The answer is, it's made out of aluminum. 

Similarly, if we want to understand arguments, we're going to gain understanding by looking carefully at the material that they're made out of. And we saw that arguments are sets of sentences, statements and propositions, so that means they're made out of language. So in this lecture and the next few, we're going to look at the nature of language in order to better understand arguments. So, if we know that arguments are made out of language, we know that the only creatures who can give arguments are ones that can use language. Now some people think that other animals can use language and there's a minimal kind of language that other animals can use. But other animals cannot use language that's complex enough to make arguments. It might seem that there's some exceptions, here's one possibility. [FOREIGN]. But no matter what it sounds like, this goat is not really arguing. Maybe he's fighting. Maybe he's fending off what he takes to be an enemy. But he's not arguing. So if other animals can use language, we can't define humans as the animal that talks, but we can define humans as the animal that argues. Or as Aristotle said the rational animal, the animal that reasons because other animals don't do that. Humans are the only one that argues and reasons in this sense. 

So, we could understand humans and arguments better if we understand language better. Now I can't tell you everything that needs to be said about language, you'd need to take a linguistics course for that and I recommend that you try one because it's very interesting. But here I'm only going to be able to make four basic points about language. First of all, language is important. Second, it's conventional. Third, it's representational, and fourth, it's social. That should at least get us going in understanding what arguments are made of. First, language is important. It would be extremely difficult to live life without language. Just try to imagine. What it would be like. It's really hard to imagine, but think about someone like Helen Keller. Who was born able to see and hear, but very shortly thereafter, lost her ability to see and hear. 

It was only much later in life that she gained the ability to use language because she never had that in her early years. And when she gained that ability, she was amazed. [SOUND]. >> W-A-T-E-R, water. It has a name. W-A-T. [SOUND] >> When Helen Keller gained the ability to use language, and to communicate. she didn't become able to see or hear, she still couldn't see or hear but she could do amazing things. She went around the country giving presentations, she graduated from Radcliff College. All of that was made available to her simply by adding language and communication to her life. So language is extremely useful. And that explains why it's all around us. Just imagine walking down the streets of a city, and all the signs that you'd see. You'd just see words here, there, and everywhere. 

And now we have a mystery. If we're not paying attention to language, then how can we use it so well to achieve so many purposes? And the answer to that lies in the second general feature of language that I want to talk about. Namely, language is conventional. But what's a convention? 

Remember that in the United States people drive on the right hand side of the road. That's our convention. 

But what does that mean? It means that there's a general pattern of behavior That most people throughout society obey on a regular basis and they criticize people who deviate from that pattern. And the same applies to language. We have certain patterns of using words in certain ways and when people deviate from those patterns, we criticize them. We say they're misspeaking or it's ungrammatical. Of course, conventions can vary. Everybody knows that there are many countries around the world where people don't drive on the right hand side of the road, they drive on the left hand side of the road. The United Kingdom's one of them, but there are lots more. 

And the same applies to language. You could have the same word that's used to mean very different things in different languages. Most notorious example is football. In the United States, it's used to refer to American football. 

Whereas, in the rest of the world it is used to refer to what Americans call soccer. And people in the rest of the world think that America is kind of silly because you don't use your feet on the ball except for punting and place kicking in football. But whether it makes sense or not, the point here is simply that the conventions can vary from one part of the world to the other. And of course you can do that with any word, you could, in English use the word money to refer to socks. at least the English language could've done that, it didn't but it could have. So in this way, conventions seem to be kind of arbitrary, it could've been very different. But language is far from completely arbitrary, because the conventions of language have limits. And two of these limits that I want to emphasize come from the fact that language is also representational and social. So first, language is representational. 

When we use language we're often trying to refer to objects in the world and describe facts in the world. And you can't change those objects or those facts merely by changing your language. 

One good story to illustrate this is about the young Lincoln. When he was a lawyer, he supposedly examined a witness during a trial and he said, okay how many legs does a horse have? And the witness said four. 

And then Lincoln said, well if we call a tail a leg. Then how many legs does a horse have? And the witness said, well, then, I suppose the horse would have five legs. And Lincoln said absolutely not, that's wrong. Calling a tail a leg doesn't make it a leg. And the point of the story, whether it's true historically or not, is that language cannot change the facts of the world. It can't make horses have five legs if you merely change your language. Here's another example, suppose that you don't have much money but you happen to have a lot of socks in your drawer. 

Well, you could say, I'm going to use the word money to refer to socks, and now all of a sudden, I've got lots of money. I'm not poor anymore. It ain't going to work. And that's because language, again, can't change your financial situation because that's a fact about the world, not about how you're using the word socks, or the word money. And the other limit on the conventions of language, comes from the fact that language is social. Sure, sometimes we talk to ourselves and use language to write things down. Write notes to ourselves, for example, without other people around. But basically language evolved because of its social function. And what that means is that there's a point in following the conventions of the language. as shared by the rest of the society that speaks that language. You know, I've always thought that it was kind of silly that grapefruits are called grapefruits. Sure they're fruits, but they don't look like grapes at all. They look more like lemons. They're like really big lemons and that's why I think they ought to be called mega lemons. 

But if I went to a restaurant and I wanted to order grapefruit juice, so I'd turn to the the service person and said I'd like some mega lemon juice, I probably wouldn't get what I wanted. And so even if I think the language is not using the right conventions, there's a point in following the conventions of the language in order to be able to communicate with other people and get what I want. And again, the great philosophers Monty Python saw this very well when they produced their little clip called, The Man Who Speaks Only in Anagrams. >> Our first guest in the studio tonight is a man who talks entirely in anagrams. >> [UNKNOWN]. >> Do you enjoy this? >> I stom certainly od. Revy chum so. >> And, what's your name? >> Hamrag. Hamrag Yatlerot. >> So, the point is obvious. Namely, language is shared. And once it's shared, then it makes sense to actually follow the conventions of society even if you don't like them. Overall then, language is important and it's conventional in ways that might seem arbitrary but actually is limited in important ways by the fact that language is also representational and social. But it's kind of cheap to say language is conventional. Which are the conventions? Which are the rules that language follows? And this is actually extremely complex because language follows rules or conventions at many different levels. Just take a real simple example, you walk into a pizza shop and you say give me pepperoni. 

Well the person then fixes a pepperoni pizza and you pay for it. But how did that work, that you said give me pepperoni? Well, first of all notice that you had to use words that were meaningful to the person you were speaking to. Gimme wasn't a word in English a long time ago, but this person understands gimme as a word, and therefore they can understand it. But in addition to those semantic constraints. You also have to have physical production constraints. You have to say it loud enough. If the pizza shop is really noisy, then you have to speak pretty loudly to get the person behind the counter to understand what you're saying. You also have to put the words in the right order. If instead of saying, gimme a pepperoni pizza, you said pizza a gimme pepperoni. They might not understand at all what you're saying. So there are structural combination rules that you have to follow as well. And there are also etiquette rules. In some pizza places if you just said, gimme pepperoni, the waiter might say, well, forget it sir. I don't serve such impolite people. I certainly would say that to my son if my son said, give me pepperoni. I wouldn't get him a pizza. I'd say you need to ask me properly. so rules of etiquette can also get in the way of communication and cooperation. So language operates at all of these levels. Physical production, semantics are the meanings of words, syntax are the rules of grammar and etiquette. 

Now all of this might seem obvious to you and, and probably should be obvious to you. but the rules of the language are not always obvious and that's what we're going to be learning throughout this course. I'll start with a simple example what's this? Well, that is a finger. Okay? But what's this? Haaaaaaa. That is a singer. This is not a finger. Haaaaaaa. And that's not a singer. Why do we pronounce the words finger with a hard g and the word singer with a soft g. That's a rule that we all follow, but 

very few people know the rule behind that pronunciation. So, do you know the rule? Take a little while and think about it. Have you got it yet? Okay, I'll tell you the answer. When a word ends in nger and is derived from a verb that ends in ng then you get a soft g like singer. But when the word that ends in nger is not derived from a verb that ends in ng then you get either a hard g like finger or a kind of medium g like plunger or danger. 

Now, when do you get that medium g or that hard g? That's a trickier question. I don't know the answer to that one, which shows that we can all use language according to rules without knowing what the rules are. We don't have to be conscious of the rules at all. And a lot of what we're going to be doing in this course, is looking behind our language to try to figure out the rules that govern the way we use language, especially when we're making arguments in order to better understand what we're doing. Some of the answers we give will be obvious, once you mention them, but I bet you hadn't thought of them before. 


上堂课我们讨论了论证的目的是什么 我们知道了论证至少有三个目的 即 说服 辩护和解释 我们还知道了阐明目的是解释事物的一种方法 于是 我们明白了为什么Joe去商店 因为我们知道了他想买些牛奶 所以他的目的就是买牛奶 以此类推 我们也可以通过目的来理解论证 这个问题我们上节课已经谈过了 但是这次我们要谈谈另一种解释 我们知道 解释东西的一种方法就是看它的材质 为什么一个Mac电脑这么轻？ 答案是 因为它的材质是铝 

以此类推 如果我们想理解论证 我们就要通过看论证由什么构成的 来理解它 我们知道 论证是一系列的句子  是陈述和命题 这代表 论证是由语言构成的 所以在这次和接下来几次课上 我们将谈谈 语言的本质 才能更好地理解论证 如果我们知道了论证是由语言构成的 我们就知道了 只有能给出论证的生物 才能运用论证 现在一些人认为 动物也能使用语言 而且其他动物能使用很小部分的语言 但是动物使用的语言并未复杂到可以做出论证 可能有时候有例外 比如这样 [不 我不是] 不管听听起来怎么样 这只山羊不是真的在争吵 可能是在打架 可能它在吓退它认为是敌人的生物 但是它这不是争论 所以 如果其他动物能使用语言 我们就不能把人类定义为 能说话的动物 但是我们可以把人类定义为 能论证的动物 或者就像亚里士多德说的 是理性的动物 是能推理的动物 因为其他动物不能 这么说来 人类是唯一能论证和推理的动物 

那么 如果我们能更好地理解语言 我们就能更好地理解人类和论证 现在我无法告诉你关于语言的一切 你需要上语言学课才能了解那么多 我推荐你试试 因为语言学非常有趣 但是现在 我将谈谈语言最基本的四点 首先 语言很重要 第二 语言遵循习俗 第三 语言的代表性 第四 语言的社交性 那至少我们先来搞清楚是什么构成了论证 第一 语言很重要 没有语言 我们的生活将极度困难 试着想象一下 没有语言 生活将怎么样 这非常难以想象 但是有的人 例如海伦·凯勒 她出生时视力和听力良好 但是没多久就丧失了视觉和听觉 

多年以后 她才拥有使用语言的能力 因为她在幼儿时她丧失了这种能力 而当她重新有了语言能力后 她完全被震惊了 [声音] W-A-T-E-R 水 它有名字 W-A-T [声音] 翻译: WindyZhang | 审核: Genie05 sjzcmm Coursera Global Translator Community它会自动平衡股票和债券  当海伦·凯勒拥有了语言能力 并用来交流 她仍然没有视觉和听觉 仍然不能看见或听见 但是她能做出让人惊叹的事情 她环游整个国家 做演讲 最后她毕业于 这些事情她都能做得很成功了 仅仅因为她有了语言能力 能进行沟通和交流了 所以语言非常有用 这就解释了为什么语言无处不在 再想象一下 你走在一个城市的一条街上 想象你一路上能看见的所有标志 你会发现 到处都是字 

这是一件神奇的事 如果我们没有注意语言 我们是如何做到熟练应用它来达成目的呢？ 这个答案就在我即将谈到的 语言的第二个一般特征里 那就是语言遵循习俗 但是习俗是什么？ 

在美国 人们靠马路的右侧行驶 这就是我们的习俗 

但是公民到底是什么？ 意思是 在社会里 有大众的行为模式 这个社会里的大多数人会遵守这种模式 他们会指责那些不守规矩的人 语言也是如此 我们有一定的语言习惯 在使用词汇时有固定用法 如果有人不这样用 我们就会批评他们 我们会说 他们发错音了 或者有语法错误 当然 惯例可以改变 周所周知 世界上这么多个国家 在某些国家人们行驶在马路右侧 有的在左侧 英国是行驶在左侧的 但是还有其他很多国家也是这样 

语言也是如此 同一个词 你使用同一个词就可能有非常不同的意思 足球（football）就是一个很好的例子 在美国 它代表美式足球 即橄榄球 

但是 在其他国家 足球（football）指的运动是美国人说的足球（soccer） 其他国家的人们觉得美国人有点蠢 因为除了踢空中球和定位球的时候 并不用脚踢球 但是无论这有没有意义 重点是 世界上不同地区的惯例不同 你可以改变任何词的意思 比如 用英语的钱来指袜子 至少英语可以这样 虽然没有这种惯例 但是它可以被创设出来 所以这么说来 习俗有些任意性 它可以变成任何不同样态 但是语言远不能完全地任意 因为语言的习俗有些限制 其中两点我想重点强调 即语言也有代表性和社会性 首先 语言具有代表性 

我们使用语言时 是想说明这个世界上的 事物和事实 而且你不能仅仅靠改变语言 来改变事物和事实 

一个小故事能很好地说明这点 林肯年轻的时候 是一个律师 在一次审判中 他问询一个证人 他问 一匹马有多少条腿？ 证人回答 四条腿 

林肯接着说 如果我们把尾巴叫成腿 那么一匹马有多少条腿？ 证人说 那么我猜是五条腿 林肯说 错了 当然不是 因为把尾巴叫成腿并不能使其真的成一条腿 无论这个故事是不是真的 重点在于 语言不能改变这个世界的事实 如果你仅仅是改变你的用词 并不能使一匹马有五条腿 另一个例子 假设 你的钱很少 但是你恰好有很多袜子 

你可以说 我用钱这个词来指袜子 这样突然之间 我就有了很多钱 我不再是个穷光蛋了 这没用的 这就是因为 语言 并不能改变你的财政状况 因为这是关于这个世界的事实 而不是关于你到底是用袜子这个词还是钱这个词 另一个语言习俗的限制 在于言语具有社会性 当然 有时候我们会自言自语 或者写点东西 例如 自己给自己写点备忘录 而身边并没有其他人 但是基本上 语言之所以发展就是因为它有社会功能 这就代表 和说这种语言的其他人一起遵守该语言的用语习惯 是有意义的 我经常在想 我们把葡萄柚叫成葡萄柚（grapefruit） 是不是有点蠢 当然 它是水果（fruit） 但是它看起来根本不像葡萄（grape） 更像柠檬（lemon） 真的很像大点的柠檬  所以我认为葡萄柚应该叫大柠檬（mega lemon） 

但是如果我去餐厅的时候想点葡萄柚汁 我对服务生说我想要 大柠檬汁 我可能没法喝到我想要的 还有 如果我觉得语言的使用没有按照正确的惯例 也必须遵守现有的惯例 最后得到我想要的 就是有意义的 最后得到我想要的 就是有意义的 而且 蒙蒂派松（Monty Python）的哲学家们在制作一个叫《颠倒顺序说话的人》的小片段时 就清楚地知道了这一点 —今晚来到我们演播室的第一位嘉宾只会用颠倒的顺序说话 — [嘟囔] —你觉得这样很开心？ —我当然这样觉得 常非 你叫什么名字？ 汉拉格 汉拉格 亚特勒罗特 —那么重点很清楚了 那就是 语言是共享的 语言一旦共享 它就有意义了 实际上就遵循了社会的用语习惯 即使你不喜欢这样的习惯 所以总体来讲 语言很重要 而且看似任意地有很多使用习惯 但是实际上在一些重要地方上 受到限制 这些限制是因为语言同时也具有代表性和社会性 但是说语言遵循习俗有点敷衍 哪些属于习俗？ 哪些是语言遵循的规则？ 这些问题十分复杂 因为语言 在很多不同层面上遵循规则或习俗 举一个既真实又简单的例子 你走进 一个披萨店 你说 给我一份意大利香肠 

然后厨师给你做了一份意大利香肠披萨 你付了钱 但是你说的那句“给我一份意大利香肠口味的”起了什么作用？ 首先 注意你运用的词语 有意义的话 给我（gimme）在很早以前不是一个英语单词 但是这个人把（gimme）当成一个词来理解 因此他们能懂这个词 但是除此之外还有语义限制 你还有身体上发声的限制 你得足够大声地说出来 如果披萨店很嘈杂 那么你就得很大声地 对柜台后的店员说话 他才能明白你在说什么 你还得用正确的语序 说话 如果你不说给我一份意大利香肠口味的 而说披萨一个给我意大利香肠口味 店员可能根本不明白你在说什么 所以有一些组合型的规则你也得遵守 还有一些礼节性的规则 在一些披萨店 如果你只说 给我意大利香肠口味的 服务生可能说 算了吧先生 我不给这样没礼貌的人 提供服务 我肯定会这样回答我的儿子 如果我儿子只说 给我意大利香肠 我不会给他一个披萨 我会说 你得礼貌地说话 所以不遵守礼节性规则也会妨碍沟通和合作 所以语言是在这些层面上综合运转的 实际生产 语义是词语的意思 句法是语法和礼仪规则 

现在这些概念看起来比较清晰了  或者可能应该比较清晰了 但语言的规则并不总是清晰明了的 这也是我们将在整个课程中学习的东西 我会从一个简单的例子开始说起 这是什么？ 恩 这是根手指 对吧？ 但这是什么？ 啊啊啊啊啊 这是一个歌手 不是一根手指 啊啊啊啊啊 这不是一个歌手 那为什么我们发音的时候 说到手指 要发重音g 而说歌手的时候发轻音g 这就一个我们都遵循的规则 

但是极少的人知道发音背后的规则 那么 你知道这个规则吗？ 给你点时间 现在思考一会儿 想出来了吗 好 我来告诉你答案 一个词语已nger结尾的时候 就是从一个用ng结尾的动词衍生而来的 所以你用轻音 比如singer 但是如果这个已nger结尾的词不是从 以ng结尾的动词 你就会发 重音g 比如finger 或者不重不轻的g 比如plunger或者danger 

那么什么时候你会发出不重不轻的或者一个重g？ 这一个比较棘手的问题 我不知道这个问题的答案 这说明 我们都能按照规则使用语言 尽管我们不知道这些规则是什么 我们根本不需要知道这些规则 而我们在这套课程里将做的事情 就是钻研语言背后的规则 去搞清楚这些规定我们如何使用语言的规则 尤其是当我们 列举论证来更好地理解我们的目标的时候 我们给出的很多答案非常浅显 你一下就能说出来 但是我猜你以前从来没想到过 

### meaning

The rules that we've looked at so far apply to every use of language. But we want to focus on those rules that are important specifically to arguments. At least normally, misspelling or mispronouncing a word doesn't affect an argument. Of course, if you pronounce one word so that it sounds like another word, it can be very confusing and people won't understand you. Or if you misspell it so badly they don't know what word you wanted, the argument is not going to work. But normally misspelling and mispronunciation don't make the argument bad. Instead, what affects the argument is what's going to affect the proposition that's getting expressed. The meaning of the sentence, because that's going to affect whether the premises justify the conclusion or whether they explain the conclusion. and so, we need to focus on those rules of language that in particular deal with the meanings of words and of sentences. 

So what's meaning? Well, one thing I can tell you is we're not going to be talking about the meaning of life in this course. The meaning of life is a totally different topic. We're also not going to be talking about whether clouds mean rain in the sense of giving some indication or evidence that there's going to be rain. 

We're concerned with the meanings of words and sentences in language. We're concerned with linguistic meaning in particular. So, how are we going to understand linguistic meaning? Well one way to think about the meanings of words and sentences is to ask how you would explain them to someone who doesn't understand them, like a small child or someone who doesn't speak this language. 

Well if somebody said, what's the meaning of the word chair? You might go, well when I use the word chair, I'm referring to these things you know, something like this. 

when I say, I am sitting on the chair, what I mean is my body is above the chair. And so, that approach to teaching language suggests to many people that what words mean is the same as what they refer to. 

and what sentences mean are the facts that they try to describe. Now that view of language is often called the referential or descriptive view of language. So is this referential or descriptive theory adequate? No, no, no, no! Absolutely not! 

That theory does not cover a lot of language that's extremely important. Just think about greeting someone in the morning. Hello! Are you referring to an object when you say, hello? 

Or think about the word not in a, in a sentence, and that the word not is going to be crucial to arguments, but does the word not refer to something separate from the other things? Well, if it did, then there would be more objects in the room when I'm not sitting on the chair than when I am sitting on the chair. 

So you cannot understand the meanings of many words, like hello or not or for that matter, am or sitting. Many words don't fit this referential or descriptive theory of meaning. So, if meaning is not referential description, what is it? Well here we're going to take our cue from Ludwig Wittgenstein, the great 20th century Austrian philosopher, who argued that meaning is use. If you want to understand the meaning of the word hello, you don't look for some object that it refers to, you ask how is it used and the answer is obvious, it's used to greet people. 

If you want to understand the meaning of the question, where's the library? The answer is, well, that question is used to inquire about the library, to ask where the library is. If you want to understand the meaning of an imperative like, gimme a pizza. Then that is a way of ordering a pizza. You're using that phrase to order a pizza. So the meaning of the phrase is given by the way those words are used in normal situations by competent speakers of the language. Now, this point about meaning being used is very important to the language of argument. 

As we saw the word not does not refer to an additional object and the same goes for the word and. When you say, I am sitting in the chair and I am in the office, the word and doesn't refer to an object either. So if we want to understand what the word and is used to do then we have to think about what people do with it. And what they do is they conjoint different sentences. They don't add an extra object or an extra fact, they just conjoin sentences and form a whole sentence out of two parts, each of which was a sentence to begin with. Of course, the word and is not always used to conjoin sentences. We can say things like Roberto and Olivia went to Sao Paulo together. And Roberto's not a sentence, Olivia's not a sentence, they're people, not sentences. And there weren't three things that went to Sao Paulo together. Roberto, Olivia, and this third thing and, whatever that is. Still, the word and is used to conjoin. In this case, it's used to conjoin things or people. In the previous examples it was used to join, conjoin sentences. But if we want to know what the word and means, we shouldn't be looking for some object that it refers to. Instead, we should be describing how it's used and what it's used to do. Namely, it's used to conjoin. And when we look more closely at the uses of language, we see that language is used in a lot of different ways. Use is diverse. Just take a simple example. I'd like to give you a little piece of personal advice. You ought to floss your teeth every day. 

So what did I just do? I uttered a bunch of words. I made physical motion in the air. But in addition, those words were meaningful, you ought to floss your teeth every day. Each of those words is meaningful in the language, and I put them together in an order that was grammatical, so the whole thing makes sense. When you make a meaningful utterance like that, we're going to say you perform a linguistic act and there's a linguistic level of the use of language that we will study in one lecture, the next lecture. But in addition, when I said you ought to floss your teeth every day, I also gave you a piece of friendly advice. I advised you. And notice that, even if you don't follow my advice, I still advised you. And, if you don't follow my advice and your teeth rot out, then I can say, look, you should've listened to me. because I advised you to floss your teeth every day. So, the speech act level occurs even when it doesn't affect your actions at all. That's the second level of use of language, the speech act level, and we'll talk about that in more detail two lectures from now. The third level of language has to do with the production of certain effects. Maybe when I say, you ought to floss your teeth everyday, I persuade you. And what that means is I bring about a certain effect on your behavior or your thought or your attitudes. 

Well, that's what we're going to call the conversational level. And conversational acts are the acts of bringing about those effects and persuasion is one example. 

So now we have three levels of language. We have the linguistic level, which is the meaningful utterance, producing a meaningful utterance. We have the speech act level. Advising is a nice paradigm of that, which can be accomplished even if you're not persuaded. And we have persuading you, which is the conversational level. So there's the linguistic level, the speech act level, and the conversational level. And each of these levels will be explored in more detail in one of the next three lectures. But here's a little warning. And you have a choice. The material in the next three lectures is a little bit more abstract and difficult than some of the things we've been through so far. Now I think it's fascinating. We're going to try to make it fun. And it's really important to understand how your language works. But it's not absolutely essential to the things that we're going to cover in the rest of this course. So it's up to you. You can listen to these three lectures if you want and there will be some exercises throughout those lectures that will test your understanding, but none of that material's going to be on the quiz. So you can listen to the next three lectures, and I hope you do, and I hope you enjoy them, but you don't have to in order to be able to go through the rest of the course and do well on the quiz at the end of this part. 

目前我们找到了语言的使用规则, 但是我们现在只想关注那些对论证来说重要的规则 一般说来 拼写错误或者发音错误 是不会影响论证的 当然 如果某个词的发音像另一个词 那就会引起歧义 大家就会不明白你的意思 再或者 如果你的拼写太糟糕 大家不知道 你想说什么 那你的论证也不会太好 但一般拼写错误和发音错误 都不会使你的论证太糟 相反 真正影响你的论证的 是句子的意义 它会影响命题的表达 因为它关系到前提是否 可以证明结论 或者是否能解释结论 因此 我们需要注意语言的规则 尤其是那些关系到词语在句中意义的规则 

那么 什么是“意义”？ 有一点可以明确 我们不是 在讨论人生的意义 在这里 人生的意义并不是本课的主题 我们也不会去探讨多云是否意味着 下雨的迹象 

我们讲的词句中的意义 是特指语言的意义 那么 如何理解语言的意义呢？ 你可以这样理解词句的意义 就是问问自己 如何向 一个不太明白它们的人 解释某个词的意思 比如向一个小朋友 或者说其他语言的人讲 

如果有人问 “椅子”这个词的意义是什么？ 你可能会这么说 嗯 当我用“椅子”这个词时 我是指一些这样子的东西 

当我说 “我坐在椅子上” 就意味着我的身体在椅子上 这种教授语言的方式 告诉我们 词的意义 等同于其所指称的事物. 

句子的意义 就是它描述的事实 这种关于语言意义的看法 被叫做语言的指称论 那么 指称论就完全正确了吗？ 不 不 不 当然不！ 

这种理论还不能解释语言的很多重要方面 想想我们早上和别人打招呼 您好！大家好！ 当你说“你好”时 你是在指称某个事物吗？ 

或者想想这个词“不” 这个词 在论证里非常重要 但这个词没有指称什么独立的事物 如果它确实指称了什么 那么当“我不坐在椅子上面”时 这个房间会比“我坐在椅子上面”时还多了一个事物“不” 

所以 （依靠指称论） 你不能理解很多像“你好”这样的词 比如“不”、“是”“坐”等等 很多词的意义不符合指称论的说法 那么 如果意义不是指称的对象的话 那么意义是什么呢？ 现在我们要提到一个人 20世纪最伟大的奥地利哲学家 路德维希·维特根斯坦 他认为语言的意义就是使用 如何你想要理解“你好”这个词的意义 你不会去寻找“你好”这个词指称的对象 你会问这个词是如何使用的 答案很明显 这个词是用来跟人打招呼的 

如果你想理解这个问句的意义 “图书馆在哪？” 答案是 这个问句是用来 询问图书馆的位置在哪里 如果你想 理解一个祈使句的意义 比如“给我一个披萨” 这个句子用来买一个披萨 你可以在你要买披萨时说这句话 所以 语句的意义由那些正常说话人 在通常情况下使用这句话的方式来决定 这种语言的“使用论” 在论证用语里非常重要 

我们 知道这个词“不”并不指称什么东西 “并且”这个词也一样 当你说 “我坐在椅子上并且 我在办公室里” “并且”这个词也没有指称任何对象 如果我们想知道“并且”这个词怎么使用 那我们就要想想人们是如何使用这个词的 人们用它来联接不同的句子 他们不用“并且”来指称事物 他们只是用它来联接句子 把两个小句子组合成一个大句子 当然了 “并且”这个词并不是总是用来联接句子 我们可以说“Roberto 和(并且) Olivia 一起去了Sao Paulo“ Roberto不是一个句子 Olivia也不是一个句子 他们是人 不是句子 再说 这也没有三个东西一起去了Sao Paulo Roberto Olivia 还有“和” 不管“和”是什么东西 “和”这个词是用来联接的 在这个例子里 它用来联接事物或者人 之前那个例子里 我们用它来联接 句子 如果我们想知道“和”这个词的意义 我们不应该去寻找它指称的东西 我们应该去寻找它是如何使用以及它被用来干嘛I 那就是 它被用来联接 当我们更仔细地认识 语言的使用之后 我们会发现语言有许多不同的使用方式 使用是多样的 举一个简单的例子 我想给你一些个人忠告 “你每天都应该使用牙线” 

我刚刚做了什么？ 我发出了一串词 我造成了空气的运动 但是 这些词是有意义的 你每天都应该 使用牙线 每一个词在语言里都是有意义的 并且 我把它们按 合乎语法的方式排列在了一起 所以这一串词有了意义 当你像我那样说了一串有意义的词时 我们 就会说你做了一个语言行动 那是语言使用论的语义层次 我们下一讲会讲到这个 还有 当我说“你每天都应该使用牙线”时 我还给了你一个友好的建议 我给了你建议 注意了 即便你没有听从我的建议 我还是给了你建议 并且 如果你没有听我的意见 你的牙都坏掉了 那我就可以说 “你看吧 你当初应该听我的才对” 因为我当初给过你建议 让你每天都应该使用牙线的 所以 即便一个句子对你没有任何影响 它也达到了言说行为的层面 这就是语言的第二个层面 言说行为层面 我们会在下下讲提到这个层面的细节 语言的第三个层面与一些具体影响有关 也许 当我说 你应该每天使用牙线时 我说服了你 这意味着 我给你造成了具体影响 不管是你的行为、态度还是思想 

你看 这些我们就打算叫它做语言的交流层面 交谈行为是指造成了影响的因为 说服就是其中的一个例子 

现在 我们知道了语言的三个层面 我们知道了语义层面 它是指有意义的话语 我们知道了言说行为层面 提建议就是这个层面的例子 即便你没有被 成功说服 当我们成功说服了你 这就是交谈层面了 现在有语义层面 言说行为层面 交谈层面 每一个层面都会在接下来的 三个视频中仔细探讨 现在是个小通知 你有一个选择 接下来三个视频的内容比起 我们目前学过的 有一点抽象和困难 我认为接下来这三讲很吸引人 我们也会把它做得尽可能有趣 它们对理解语言的运作也非常重要 但它对我们接下来的课来说 也不是绝对必要 所以 你来决定吧 你可以听听接下来这三个视频 如果你想的话 会有一些嵌在视频中的小练习 用来检验你是否理解了这些内容 但这些内容都不会在测验里出现 所以 你可以听听下面三个视频 我也希望你去听并且享受这个过程 但你想要在这个 部分拿到高分 接下来三个视频对你来说 并不是必须要听的 

### linguistic acts


So as we saw last time there are three distinct levels of language: linguistic level, the speech level, and the conversational level. And all of these levels of meaning affect arguments. So in the next three lectures we want to work through these levels one by one. And this lecture is going to deal in particular with the linguistic level of language, which is simply the production of a meaningful utterance. So in order to perform a linguistic act, all you have to do is utter a set of words that are meaningful. That fit together according to the semantics. That is, the meanings of particular words. And the syntax or the grammar of the language in general. For example, it's easy. It's easy is a linguistic act. Because it's as a contraction, you're allowed to contract it and is according to the rules of English. And easy is a word, so, it's easy, follows the semantics, and the syntax of the language of English. That's all there is to it. Now although linguistic acts are really simple, they do require some special components that are worth separating out, 

for example, they require meaningful words. When you simply hum a tune like [MUSIC], 

then you're not performing a linguistic act. Because there are no meaningful words in it. But when you sing a song, [MUSIC]. I love Miranda and Nicholas too. Then, you are performing a linguistic act, because you uttered words that were meaningful when they were put together in that way. And I've been taking this for granted, but of course, the words you utter have to be meaningful. it's not going to be a linguistic act if you utter, a, what looks like a sentence. Namely, a set of sounds. That look like words if they're not really words. So if you say, twas brillig and the slithy toves did grye and gimble in the wabe. And so on from Louis Carroll's famous Jabberwocky poem. Then it's not going to be a linguistic act, if those words are not meaningful words in any language. And you can also get nonsense when you take words that have meanings and put them together in an order that doesn't make any sense. 

My dog has fleas makes sense but dog fleas my has doesn't make any sense. So meaningful words with the wrong grammatical structure won't work and Noam Chomsky from MIT taught us that you can also get nonsense when you take words that make sense and you put them together with the right grammatical structure, but they still don't fit together because of the relation between the meanings. 

His example here was colorless green ideas sleep furiously. What does that mean? Colorless green ideas sleep furiously? Well colorless makes sense; green that's a word, ideas, sleep, furiously. Each of those words makes sense and they're each in their appropriate grammatical role, but altogether it doesn't make any sense. So they're lots of ways you can get nonsense in language. And when you do, you're not performing a linguistic act. You know there's some really fun examples where it's not clear whether or not the utterance is meaningful. Now, some of these examples, among my favorites are garden path sentences. Here's one. The man who whistles tunes pianos. Wait a minute. What does that mean? If you think of it as the man who whistles tunes is one unit, then you don't understand what the word pianos is doing, because the man who whistles tunes sounds like a reference to a particular man, and pianos is not a verb. 

But if you think of it as the man who whistles is one unit 

and the second unit is tunes pianos, so it's the man who whistles tunes pianos. Then it makes sense, because it's the man who's whistling also tunes pianos. 

So you have to be able to carve the set of words up into the right units and see what grammatical structure they have in order to understand the sentence. because tunes can either be a verb, which tells you what the man is doing to the pianos, or it can be a noun which refers to the thing that the man is whistling. And you have to get those grammatical categories straight and the garden path sentences lead you astray and make you think of it in the wrong way and there'll be some more examples of that in the exercises. 

But my favorite example of all is buffalo, buffalo, buffalo. What does that mean? Well buffalo are American bison, okay. But buffalo, the word buffalo in English that is, can also be used as a verb to refer to tricking or fooling someone. So you can have buffalo, American bison, buffaloing, that is tricking or fooling, buffalo, American bison. Buffalo buffalo buffalo. But you can go even further, because there's a city in New York named Buffalo, and of course, there can be buffalo, that is American bison, from the city of Buffalo, New York and they're called Buffalo, buffalo. And when they trick or fool other bi, American bison from Buffalo New York, then you have Buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo. 

Or buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo. Which doesn't sound like a meaningful utterance, but it is. And you can go even further, you can actually build it out to 11 straight utterances of the word buffalo. Buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo. Now, tell me what that means. I'm not going to explain it to you, because it takes a while to explain it. But If you think about it, you might be able to figure it out. And even if you can't figure out eleven buffalos in a row, the point still holds, because the point's just that sometimes what doesn't seem meaningful turns out to be meaningful, and if you're careful and, and charitable, and do your best to interpret what it really means, then you might be able to make sense out of some utterances that don't seem to make sense at first. And then when you can makes sense out of them, then they're linguistic acts. For now, I don't have time to go into any detail on semantics or syntax, although we will discuss some details when we discuss vagueness and ambiguity in the discussion of fallacies later in this course. But I hope that the linguistic level is pretty simple and understandable, so we can go on and look in more detail at the speech act level and the conversational act level. 

翻译：随心 校对：你看上节课我们讲到了 论证中的语言有三种不同的水平 语言水平 语用水平和交流水平 所有这些层次都会影响论证 所以 在接下来的三讲中 我们将逐一介绍这三个水平 这一讲重点介绍语言水平 这一水平是由个体言辞的直接产物 即 要达到论证中的语言水平 你只需要 给出一系列组合起来的有意义的词汇 这意味着特定意义的词汇 以及语法的综合 比如 给出一句话“这很简单” 就是语言行为了 这句话是一个缩略句 符合英语的语法 句子中的“简单”是一个词汇 具有特定的含义 并按语法出现在句中的适当位置 这就是语言水平的全部内涵 但是 语言行为虽简单 你还是需要学习一些不属于语言行为的例子 比方说 语言水平必须要具有特定含义的词汇 如果你只是哼个调调 

[哼调] 那么你在做的就不是语言行为 [音乐] 

但如果你在唱歌 [音乐] “我爱Miranda和Nicholas”  因为你将单词组织起来了 让它们有了意义 当然 词语必须是有意义的 如果你只是罗列了一堆声音 而不是真正的单词 只是看起来像是一个句子 那么这就不是语言行为 比方你说“twas brillig and the slithy toves did grye and gimble in the wabe ” 这样的从Louis Carroll的无厘头的诗歌中摘出的“句子” 如果某词汇在任何语言中都不是有意义的词汇 就不是语言水平的行为 不仅如此 把真正的词汇放在一起 也有可能没有任何意义 “我的狗有跳蚤”就是有意义的话 但“狗蚤我的有”就不是 所以 不可以将有意义的词汇按照错误的语法结构排列 另外 麻省理工的语言学家诺姆·乔姆斯基指出 即便你所使用的词汇是有意义的 

并按正常语序排列 它们仍有可能因为其内容毫不相关而无法组成句子 比如说 “无色的绿色观点狂怒地睡着” 是什么意思？ “无色的绿色观点狂怒地睡着”？？无色的说得通 绿色也是一个词汇 

观点、狂怒、睡觉也都有其各自的意义 它们确实是按照正常的语序组合的 但并不能组成有意义的句子 所以 这里有很多种方式去获得无意义的语言 当你这么做了 你就不是在进行语言行为 而一些十分有趣的例子 你不能明确它是不是有意义 其中的一些是我最喜欢的 比如园径句（指一些有歧义的句子） 这里有个例子 “男人吹调调钢琴”（The man who whistles tunes pianos） 等一下 这是什么意思？ 如果你觉得“男人吹调调”（the man who whistles）是一个语言单位 你就不会明白“钢琴”在这里是干什么的 因为吹调调的男人听起来像特指某个人 而钢琴是个名词 中间没有动词连接不上 但如果你将“男人吹调”（the man who whistles）当成一个单元 另一个单元是“调钢琴”（tunes piano） 句子就可理解为吹调的男人在调钢琴 这样就可以讲的通了 因为一个吹调子的男人同时也可以调钢琴 

所以 你必须将一句话中的词语按正确的单位切割 

看清楚它的语法结构 才能理解它 

上述例子中“调”既可以成为一个动词 告诉你男人在调整钢琴 也可以成为一个名词 告诉你男人吹的是“调调” 你必须把句中的语法结构厘清 而园径句让你迷路 让你用错误的方式思考 这里还有很多例子 但我最喜欢举的是“buffalo buffalo buffalo” 这是什么？ 首先 buffalo是美洲野牛 

但在英语中 它也是个动词 表示愚弄他人 它们确实是按照正常的语序组合的 但并不能组成有意义的句子 “Buffalo buffalo buffalo” 但是进一步想 美国纽约西部的一个城市叫水牛城（Buffalo） 所以 这个词就可以代表在美国 纽约中的某城 人们叫这里出来的野牛：buffalo buffalo 当城中的野牛愚弄同城的野牛 你就可以说“Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo” 这个句子听起来没有任何含义 但其实它有 当然 你还可以进一步组合 将11个buffalo组合在一起 Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo 

现在告诉我这个句子的意思 我就不解释了 好好思考一下 你会找到答案 即便是你看不出11个buffalo的含义 这个例子要说明的已经足够清晰 那就是 有时候看起来无意义的句子 会变得有意义 如果你足够的仔细 有耐心 尽你最大的努力去解释它们 你就会发现 某些言辞从一开始的时候让人觉得毫无意义 但之后 你会从中发现意义 它们就是语言行为 我没有时间 解释具体的语义与语法 尽管在接下来的课中 我们确实会再次关注语言水平 解释论证中的谬误所存在的语言模棱两可之处 但我希望论证的语言水平 对你们来说已经足够的清晰简明 这样我们就可以 了解其意义 明白它们是语言行为了 暂时 我没有时间来讲 语义学或句法学的细节问题 尽管我们会在讨论模糊和歧义时谈到 模糊和歧义会在后面谬误的课程中涉及 但我希望以本课的语言学的水平 对大家是相当简单易懂的（大家有必要学习） 这样我们就能继续深入言语行为层面 和会话行为层面了【教育无边界字幕组】  

### speech acts

The second level of language that we want to discuss is speech acts. We already saw one instance in the example of advising, when I advised you to floss your teeth everyday. But clearest examples probably occurs in games and in ceremonies. 

One famous incident that occurred, I believe in a Yankees game, was when a batter had two strikes and three balls and the pitcher threw the ball near the strike zone, and the batter didn't swing, so the umpire didn't say anything. And the batter turned to the umpire and said, well ump, am I out or was that a walk? And the umpire said, you ain't nothing till I say so. And that's the lesson of speech acts. With a speech act the saying so that makes you so. And the rules of baseball mean that you're out and it was a strike if the umpire says so, but you walk and it was a ball if the umpire says so. Now, maybe the umpire should have called a ball when he called strike or should have called a strike when he called a ball, but it doesn't matter because he makes a mistake and calls it a strike and you're out. So the next kind of example involves ceremonies. Imagine that you're at traditional marriage ceremony and the bride and the groom show up with an officiant in an appropriate location and the officiant says to the man, do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife? And he says, I do. Then the officiant turns to the bride and says, do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband? And she says, I do. Then the officiant says, I now pronounce you husband and wife. That's pretty cool. By uttering those words, he made them husband and wife. The words changed their relationship in a legal way, in a religious word and in a personal way. All of that happened just by uttering words. 

And notice also that you can use a special little word to explain this. You can say that, he thereby pronounced them husband and wife. By uttering the words, I now pronounce you husband and wife, he thereby pronounced them husband and wife because it was right then and there in those words, by means of those words, that he made them husband and wife. 

These words provide us with a nice general test called the thereby test. 

Here's a certain pattern of words. If I say, I blank, then I thereby blank. I blank by means of saying I blank. 

Now sometimes filling in that blank with some words will make sense, but it won't make sense with other words, and that will provide a test because when you can fill in that blank with a verb and it makes sense, then that verb names a speech act. So for example, if I say, I now pronounce you man and wife, then I thereby pronounce you man and wife. My speech act is pronouncing you. And if I say, I apologize I thereby apologize. 

Notice that what the formula does is it takes you from the words, which are in quotation marks in the if clause of the thereby test to the world, because when it's not inside quotation marks on the right side of the thereby test it refers to the world. So when it's in quotation marks it's about the words and when it's not in quotation marks on the right side it refers to the world and the formula takes you from the words to the world. And that's what's tricky about it. It's amazing that you can actually use your words to change the world, but only in the special case of speech acts. Of course all of this works only in the right circumstances. You can't just randomly walk up to any couple on the street and say, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Just try it. >> Excuse me, I wanted to say something. I now pronounce you husband and wife. >> Thank you. [LAUGH] >> Whoa, I'm lucky they didn't hit me. You obviously cannot pronounce people husband and wife if you're not an officiant, they're not a bride and a groom who have said, I do. It has to occur in the right circumstances. 

And sometimes, which circumstances are the right circumstances will be very controversial. 

People argue about whether a man can marry man or a woman can marry a woman. 

The ones who think that you can't, think that marriage has, as part of its appropriate circumstances, that only people of different genders can get married. A man can marry a woman, but can't marry another man. Whereas, other people think that a man can marry a man and a woman can marry a woman. So it's going to be controversial which circumstances are appropriate for a marriage ceremony, but everybody agrees that you can't just do it randomly to any old couple on the street. So everybody agrees that there are going to be limits and that the speech act works only in the appropriate circumstances and we can build that into the thereby test by just adding a few words. If I say, I blank in the appropriate circumstances, then I thereby blank. But it's only in the appropriate circumstances that you can perform this speech act by uttering the words. 

Now we can use the thereby test to pick out speech acts because it works for a lot of different examples. If I say, I promise to meet you for lunch tomorrow in the appropriate circumstances that I thereby promise to meet you for lunch tomorrow. 

So promising is a speech act. If I say, I thank you for inviting me to your party, and throwing such a great party by the way. 

Then I do thereby thank you for inviting me to your party and for throwing such a good party by the way. 

So thanking is a speech act. If I say, I apologize for tripping over your legs, then I thereby apologize for tripping over your legs. Notice that the circumstances matter in all these cases. If I say I apologize, I mean, I don't really feel sorry then, I did apologize, but it was an insincere apology because the circumstances weren't right since I didn't have the appropriate feelings. But, I still did apologize. Now, in contrast, whether I promise you or threaten you, depends on whether the thing that I promise or threaten to do is something that you want. If you want me to do it, then I'm promising. But if you don't want me to do it, then I might be threatening. So your attitudes towards the thing that I'm going to do determines whether my speech act is a promise or a threat. In all of these cases, the circumstances are going to matter. So in that example the circumstances affect which speech act I'm going to perform. But in other cases the circumstances affect whether I really perform any speech act at all or fail to perform the speech act that I was trying to. Here's an example on that. If I say to you, I bet you that Duke will win the next National Championship and I think Ron Netta might be foolish enough to take that bet. Then what if he responds by saying, no, I won't bet you. Now, have I performed a speech act of betting? No. Have I performed another speech act? Not really. What have I performed? So sometimes when the circumstances aren't right you perform a different speech act and sometimes when the circumstances aren't right you don't perform any speech act at all. It really is very sensitive to the particular circumstances in which you're speaking. But why do we care about speech acts here, when we're supposed to be studying arguments. Well that's because arguing is a speech act. You argue with language. It's one of those things that you do in using language is a certain way. You're intending to provide reasons and you're providing what you take to be a reason to justify or explain the conclusion. And justifying and explaining are other things that you do with language. Those are speech acts too. So when we're studying arguments, we're studying a particular kind of speech act and that's why it makes it important to understand speech acts because we need to view arguing in the context of these other speech acts that I've just discussed. Now there's an awful lot more to say about speech acts and I can't say it here. In these lectures I just want to give the idea in a very basic and simple way. If you want more detail, we have a more extended discussion of speech acts in the accompanying book Understanding Arguments. But just to make sure you understand the basics let's do a few exercises first and then in the next lecture we'll go on to talk about conversational acts. 

我们将要讨论的 语言的第二个层面 是言语行为 我们已经看过 一个关于提出建议的例子 我建议你每天使用牙线 不过最明了的例子 估计还是出现在比赛和仪式中 

一个很著名的事件 我觉得是在洋基队一场比赛中 一个击球手已打出两个好球和三个坏球 投手将球投至好球区 击球手没有挥棒 裁判未置一词 然后击球手转向裁判 问道 嗯 我出局了么 或者 被保送上垒？ 然后裁判回答 你保持原状直到我给出指示 那么这就是言语行为的一个例子 一个言语行为 通过说某句话 而让你完成了这句话对应的某个行为 棒球的规则就是说 如果裁判说这是个好球 你就被判出局 如果裁判说这个是坏球 你就被保送上垒 现在 当裁判认定是好球时 其实应该是个坏球 或者他认定是坏球时 其实是个好球 不过这不重要 事实是他犯了个错 判定该球为好球 而你出局了 接下来这个例子是关于仪式的 试想你正在参加一场传统的婚礼仪式 一对新人出现了 还有一位婚礼主持人 主持人问新郎：你愿意娶你身边的女士为妻么？ 新郎回答：我愿意 接着 主持人转向新娘 问道：你愿意嫁给身边这位男士为妻么？ 新娘答道：我愿意 然后主持人说道：现在我宣布你们彼此结为夫妻 这看上去很酷这看上去很酷 就说了几句话 主持人就能使一对新人成为夫妻 这些说出的话 合法地改变了后者间的关系 无论是从宗教意义上还是个人意义上 这些的发生 仅通过说几句话 

请注意 你同样可以用一个特别的词来说明这个 你可以这样说：他由此宣布他们结为夫妻 通过这句话 我现在宣布你们是夫妻了 他因而宣布他们结为夫妻  这归因于那时那点的那几句话 通过这些话 他使得他们正式成为夫妻 

这些句子描述了一种被称为“因而测试”的一般性测试 

这里是一个 (该类型)语句的既定模式 如果我说 我走神了 那么我确实走神了 我通过说[空格]这句话来描述 我[空格]这个行为 

那么 有时候部分填词 是有意义的 而填入另一些词则不会 这样就需要一种测试 因为如果你填入某个动词 而使得句子有意义 则这个动词被称为 言语行为 那么举个例子 如果我说 我现在宣布你们结为夫妻 那么我因此宣布你们结为夫妻 我此处的言语行为是 宣布你们 (pronoucing you) 那如果我说 我道歉 我就因此道了歉 

请注意 这个语言模式 能让你 通过“因而测试” 将if语句中的引用部分 在现实世界中实现 因为如果 这些语句不是 因而测试右边 被引用的部分  这些语句就是与现实世界相关联 所以 如果语句出现在引号内 就是单纯的语句 如果出现在引号外 而是在右边部分 那么就与现实世界相关 所以 该公式 能将你说的话与现实世界的行为相关联 这其中的微妙之处就在于 你可以通过语句来完成现实世界中的某种行为 这点令人着迷 不过这也只是在言语行为的特定情况下 当然的 这只在特定的条件下才能凑效 你没法走到大街上 随便就对一对夫妻说 我现在宣布你们结成夫妻 你可以试试 — 打扰一下 我想说件事 我现在宣布你们结成夫妻 这是他们的列表 这是我们的 有人发现什么规律了吗？[LAUGH] — 哇 他们居然没打我 我真够幸运的 如果你不是神甫 很显然你无法宣布人们结为夫妻 他们不是说 “我愿意” 的新郎和新娘  这些必须在特定情况下才能实现 

然而有时 即使这些是在这些特定情况下 也会存在争议 

人们对 同性之间 是否能结婚 表示质疑 

那些认为不可以的人 认为所谓婚姻 考虑其合适的前提 只能存在于不同性别的两人之间 一个男人能与一个女人结婚 但不可以跟另一个男人 不过 也有人认为一个男人可以与同性结婚 女人也一样 所以 对于结婚仪式来说 (如何定义) 合适的情况是存在争议的 不过大家都赞成 不能随机选择马路上的恋人完成这个仪式 因此 大家都认为 言语行为的发生受到限制 它必须满足一些特定条件 我们可以在因而测试中填入部分词语来构建这些条件 如果当且仅当 我说 在特定的环境下我 [空格] 那么我因此 [空格] 了 但只有在特定的情况下 你才能通过说出这个句子完成言语行为 

现在 我们可以用因而测试 来确认符合的言语行为 因为 这个可以有很多适用的例子 如果我说 我答应你在合适的情况下与你明天共进午餐 那么 我因此答应明天与你共进午餐 

因此 答应 (promosing) 就是一个言语行为 如果我说 我感谢你邀请我参加聚会 并且聚会如此令人难忘 

那么我就完成了一个感谢行为 即感谢你邀请我 并且感谢你举办了令人难忘的聚会 

所以 感谢 (thanking) 就是一个言语行为 如果我说 我为绊到你的腿表示道歉 那么 我因此完成了道歉的行为 为绊到你的腿而道歉 请注意 上述例子中 每个特定情况都能使句子通过测试 如果我说 我道歉 不过我其实 我其实并不感到抱歉 我确实道了歉 这并不是个诚恳的道歉 因为我其实内心并无歉意 这个条件根本没被满足 但我仍然完成了道歉的行为 现在 反过来说 我的行为最终是 允诺或威胁你 取决于我说话的内容 是否是你期望的 如果你希望我这么做 那么我的行为即是允诺 否则 我也许就是在威胁你 所以你对于我所说内容的想法 决定了我的言语行为是 允诺还是威胁 在上述的例子 所有的条件都能使句子通过测试 在最后那个例子中 特定条件决定了 我的言语行为的 性质 不过在其他例子中 这些条件也将决定 我是否真的完成了言语行为 或者我并未最终实现我的言语行为 这里有一个相关的例子 如果我对你说 我跟你打赌 杜克将是下届全国冠军 并且 我认为 朗•奈特 可能会笨到和我打赌 然后 如果他说了“不，我不会跟你打赌” 而拒绝了我 那么 我是否完成了 打赌 (betting) 这个言语行为呢？ 没有 那我是否完成了其他的言语行为？ 并非如此 那么我完成了什么？ 因此 有时当条件不符合时 你完成了另一个不同的言语行为 而有时 当条件不符合时 你未完成任何言语行为 是否能完成特定的言语行为 与你说话时的特定环境 紧密相关 不过 为什么在我们研究论证的时候 会关注言语行为 那是因为 论证就是一个言语行为 语言是你论证的载体 论证是你对语言的一种特定用法 你试图提供理由 你提供手边能成为理由的依据 来加强或解释某个结论 而 加强和解释 是语言的另一个用途 它们同样是言语行为 因此 当我们研究论证时 我们实际在研究言语行为中的一个特定类型 这就是掌握言语行为的重要性 因为我们需要 在上述提到的几种背景下 研究论证 提到言语行为 还要许多有趣的话题 此处暂且不表 这门课中 我只会给出基本 简单的 (关于言语行为的) 定义 如果你希望了解更多的细节 在课程相关的书籍《掌握论证》中 我们更深入地探讨了这个话题 不过首先 你得确认你掌握了基本的概念 我们先来做几个练习 在下一讲中 我们将介绍交流行为

### conventional acts

So now we've discussed two levels of language. The linguistic level and the speech act level. In this lecture, we want to look at the third level of language. Nominally the level of conversational acts. And the basic idea is really simple. We use language to bring about a change in the world. For example, I might turn to a friend and say, could you loan me your car? 

Well, what am I doing? I'm performing a speech act of requesting or asking a favor. Something like that. 

But am I doing it just for its own sake? Did I ask a favor just in order to be asking a favor? Like it was fun to ask a favor? No. I was asking a favor, to bring about a certain effect. I wanted him to hand over the keys to his car so I could use it. And I wanted him to give me permission to use his car, so I could do it legally. So I'm trying to bring about a change, not only in the physical location of the keys, but also in the legal rights that I have with regard to his car. So I'm trying to bring about a change in the world. Simply by uttering those words, could you please loan me your car? 

It happens all the time. Here's another example. 

Suppose my friend is wondering whether the moon is full. And I say, the moon is full. Well am I uttering those words just to expel hot air? No. Am I uttering those words just to express my own belief? No. I'm trying to inform my friend. I'm trying to bring about a change in my friend's beliefs, and that's to bring about an effect in the world. So that's a conversational act. To bring about the effect in the world of informing my friend. Informing is a conversational act. And almost all speech acts have particular effects that are associated with them. When you ask a question, you're trying to bring about someone answering the question. When you apologize, you're trying to bring about forgiveness. When you promise somebody, you're trying to bring about the person relying on your promise in order to believe that you're going to do it. So speech acts are often associated with particular effects that the speaker intends to bring about and the bringing about of that effect is the conversational act. So if we want an official definition of a conversational act we can say that the conversational act is the bringing about of the intended effect, which is the standard effect for the kind of speech act that the speaker is performing. That's what a conversational act is. Now. Since the conversational act is the bringing about of the standard effect. The conversational act does not occur when that effect does not occur. And that find seem weird that what kind of act you perform depends on whether the effect occurs maybe several seconds, maybe even longer even longer in the future. But it's not that weird when you think about it. Because if you pull the trigger of a gun that's pointed at someone, then whether your act of pulling the trigger is an act of killing, depends on whether the person dies. And yet the person's death is something independent of it. It's an effect that occurs, maybe quite a while in the future, but your act wasn't an act of killing unless the person died. And that's the story of conversational acts. Your act is not this conversational act unless, the effect occurs. It has to be the intended effect, that's the standard effect for the kind of speech act that you're performing. So, the really tricky question is, how are we going to bring about these effects? because it's not so easy. 

Think about how other people bring about effects. Think about a baker baking a cake. Well, the baker needs to get together the right ingredients and bring them to the right place, get the right amount of ingredients. You know, if a baker fills the entire kitchen with flour, he's not going to have any room left over to bake the cake. And has to bring the right ingredients. That means, if instead of bringing flour he brings gravel, he can't bake a cake. And he has to put together those ingredients in the right way, in the right order for example. You can't mix them in the wrong order, the cake won't work out. And has to bake it for the right amount of time and so on and so on. So there're a lot of tricky rules about how to bring about the effect of a good cake. Well the same thing applies to conversational acts. They're going to be rules that have to be followed, in order to bring about the conversational act that you're trying to bring about. That is in order to have that intended effect of the speech act in the circumstances. And the same kind of rules apply to any rational person trying to pursue any goal. Whenever you want to bring about an effect, you have to follow certain general rules. And so it applies to people who are trying to bring about effects by language, that is, to people who are trying to perform conversational acts. If you want to inform someone, that is, to have an effect on their beliefs, then you need to speak in a certain way. And if you want to promise someone, that is to get them to rely on you, that's the conversational act associated with the speech act of promising. But you're not going to get them to rely on you unless you follow certain rules. And so what we need to try to understand are the rules of language that enable us to bring about these effects that are the conversational acts. Now on this question Paul Grice helps us out a lot, he's one of the great philosophers of the 20th century. And he laid out a series of rules governing conversational acts. He called them the conversational maxims. And we're going to look at them one by one. Grice focuses in on context where people are stating things and where they're cooperating with each other and trying to inform each other. He's not trying to provide a general theory so it's for statements in a cooperative context. 

So the first maxim is the rule of quantity and it basically says, don't say more than is required for the purpose that you're trying to achieve. If you say too many words the point gets lost in the words so you shouldn't say more than you need for the purpose at hand. The second part of the rule of quantity is you shouldn't say too little. Right? Because if you say too little then that's going to be misleading and it's not going to fulfill your purpose because the person that you're talking to won't have all the information that they need. 

Second rule is the rule of quality. The rule of quality says, don't say what you don't believe to be true. Don't lie. Don't mislead. Don't deceive. Right? But also this is the second part of the rule of quality. Don't say something that you lack adequate justification for. Because you shouldn't just be talking off the top of your head. With no reason to believe what you're saying. These are all pretty common sense rules, but they weren't apparent to people until Grice formulated them. The third rule is the rule of relevance and it's the toughest of all. The rule of relevance says, be relevant. Look, it's short, I'll grant you that. It's going to be easy to remember, I'll grant you that. But it really is kind of tricky to apply the rule, because you have to figure out what's relevant and we'll see some problems with that, but for now just remember that it should be obvious. When you're talking about a subject and you want to achieve a certain purpose and the person you're talking to is cooperating with you, as Grice is assuming, then you ought to be talking about things that are relevant. And if you change the subject, that's going to be very misleading. And the fourth conversational maxim is the rule of manner. It says be brief, be orderly. Avoid obscurity, and avoid ambiguity. Pretty simple, it's all about style because if you're not brief enough, people won't pay attention to you. If it's not orderly people will get confused by that, and if you're ambiguous or obscure then people won't understand what you're saying. So these four rules are followed by speakers when they're cooperating with each other. When people aren't cooperating, they're trying to trick or deceive each other, they might violate these rules, and mislead people by abusing these rules. But when they're cooperating, these are the rules they follow and that makes them able to deceive people by violating them. And also notice that these rules might not be completely clear to you. You might not have ever thought of them before, but now that you mention them they probably seem pretty obvious. It's kind of like the finger and singer rule that we saw before regarding pronunciation. That's a rule that you hadn't thought of before but once it's pointed out it seems kind of obvious. Well that's what Grice has done. But he's shown us the rules governing conversational acts that enable us to bring about certain effects by language. Now we can use these rules to understand what's going on in a lot of conversations. Imagine you're at a restaurant and the waiter walks up to your table and says, well for dessert you can have cake or ice cream. 

Well. What has that waiter suggested? He's suggested that that's all you can have cake, ice cream. Well he didn't mention pie so you can't have pie. Because if he's a good waiter and he knows that they have pie back there and you can order it, then he ought to be telling you about the pie. He would be violating the rule of quantity, that is not providing you all the relevant information, if he said you can have cake or ice cream and you can also have pie but he didn't mention pie. So because you assume that he's cooperating with you and trying to get you what you want to eat, since he is your waiter, after all, there must not be pie available. So you say, I'll take ice cream, even though you would have preferred pie. 

What's happening here is called conversational implication. When the waiter said you could have cake or ice cream, he was conversationally implying that you can't have pie. And the reason that he conversationally implied that is because, if he were cooperating and following the conversational rules, or maxims, then he would have mentioned pie. So you assumed that since he said only cake and I, cake or ice cream, that you can't have pie. He, in effect, conversationally implied that you cannot have pie. And the way you figured that out was you took what he said, a little background knowledge about him being a waiter and having certain goals and what happens in restaurants. Performed a little mini calculation using the maxim of quantity. And inferred that he must believe that you can't have pie. And of course since he's a waiter, he ought to know whether you can have something else or not, and therefore you can't have pie. But what if he had a favorite customer at another table and he knew there was only one slice of pie back there and he didn't want you to order it? 

And he said, you can have cake or ice cream. And didn't mention the pie so you wouldn't order it and his favorite customer would get it instead of you. Well, he still conversationally implied that you can't have pie. But he misled you. He misled you because he was trying to get the pie for somebody else. He was not cooperating with you. So the tricky thing about these conversational maxims is they work perfectly fine when you're cooperating with the person and trying to give them all of the information that they need for your common purpose with that other person. But if you're not cooperating then you can use them to mislead the other person. And that's the double edged sword of conversational implication. 

But one of the features of conversational implication is really important to arguments, and that's that you can cancel conversational implications. The waiter can say you can have cake or ice cream, oh yeah, and you can also have pie. And when he said, and also you can have pie, he did not take back you can have cake or ice cream, because you can still have cake or ice cream. It's just that, you can also have pie. 

So, we can cancel the conversational implication that you cannot have pie by saying, oh, yeah, and you can also have pie. 

So with a conversational implication, if a certain sentence, P, conversationally implies another sentence, Q, then you can deny Q and P still might be true. 

And that's an important fact because it distinguishes conversational implications from logical entailments or logical implications. If I say Alice is my sister, then that implies Alice is female, and I can't go, Alice is my sister, oh yeah, and she's not female. That doesn't make any sense because if she's not female, she can't be my sister because that's a logical implication or entailment. 

But with a conversational implication instead, you can deny what is conversationally implied. And the original sentence is still true. So if the waiter says you can have cake, or ice cream, and then, I find out that he's been saving the last piece of pie for this other table, then I can come up to him and say wait a minute, you lied to me. He didn't really lie to me, because what he said was still true. I could have cake or ice cream. It's still true, I can have cake or ice-cream. He didn't say anything false to me. He simply didn't mention the pie that I could also have. So that's very different in the case of conversational implication, than in the case of logical entailment. And that'll be important to us, especially when we get to formal logic, in a later part of this course. So let me give you another example that's more important. Imagine a politician says I've got a policy that's going to reduce crime by getting criminals off the streets. And the policy is lock them all up. When people are suspected of crimes, you'll lock them all up. That's going to get criminals off the street. 

Well that might convince people if they don't notice that he's left out another fact. He's not just going to get people off the street who are criminals, he's going to get lots of other people off the street too. He didn't give you all the relevant information, like the waiter who mislead you with the pie. He suggested that his policy will solve the problem of crime by putting people in prison who would commit crimes. And just left out the other relevant fact, that it's going to put lots of other people in prison too. So he has conversationally implied that there's no other relevant facts to consider by only mentioning that it's going to reduce the crime rate. And you have to be good at looking through that implication and asking, yes, but is there something he's leaving out? And that's often what you need to do in order to avoid being misled by sleazy politicians and other people who leave out the relevant information for the issue that you're talking about. Now, of course, the politician might not care that he misled you, that might be the goal. He wants to persuade you and he doesn't care whether he misleads you because it's persuasion not justification that he's interested in. 

In addition, he's got his defense ready. He can say, but I didn't say anything false, what I said was true. If we put all those potential criminals in jail we're going to reduce the crime rate. Maybe it's also true that we're going to put some innocent people in jail, but we will reduce the crime rate and that's what I said. What Grice's maxim of quantity does is it tells us exactly why we have a criticism of him now. We can say he's not cooperating because he's not following the conversational maxim of quantity. He's not giving us all the relevant information that we need in order to achieve our purpose if we have a common purpose. And this politician is pretending to have a common purpose with us, the good of the country, when actually he doesn't have a common purpose with us, he just wants to get elected. 

And so Grice gives us an insight into what's going on when we get misled in those contexts, and also what we need to do to respond to those types of bad arguments. Now this distinction between conversational implication and logical entailment is crucial to arguments, because it tells us something about how to refute arguments. When you don't like the premise of an argument, because it's misleading, because it conversationally implies something false. That's not a way to show that the premise is false. In order to show it's false you have to show that it actually logically entails something that's false then you can infer that the premise itself is false. This will become important later when we look at the role of conversational implication and logical entailment in arguments. But for now, the important thing is to understand the distinction between conversational implication and logical entailment. Speakers usually follow these conversational maxims that Grice enunciated, when they speak, and when they're cooperating. But they don't always follow these maxims, sometimes they violate them. And of course, as always, there's a lot more to be said about conversational acts. If you want to learn more about conversational acts you should look at the chapter in understanding arguments in the text that accompanies this course. 

But I think we've learned enough about conversational acts to move on. Because so far we've looked at language in general at the linguistic level, at the speech act level, and at the conversational act level. Now we want to take these lessons. And apply them more specifically to the language of argument. That is the particular kind of language that gets used in arguments. And that's what will be the topic for the next few lectures. 

我们已经讨论了语言的两种层面 即语义层面和言语行为层面 在这堂课中 我们将要探讨语言的第三个层面 它的名称是交谈行为 基本理念非常简单 我们通过语言 造成世上的某种变化 比如 我对一个朋友说 你能把车借我吗 

我在做什么呢？ 我在进行一个要求或请求帮助的言语行为 之类的东西 

但我仅仅是为了它自身的缘故才这么做吗 我只是为了请求帮助而请求帮助吗 好像这样做很有趣似的 不是的 我请求帮助 是想造成某种特定效果或目的 我想让他给我车钥匙 这样我就能用了 我还想让他允许我用他的车 这样我就能合法使用它 所以我在试着造成一种变化 并不仅是钥匙的物理位置移转  不仅是钥匙物理位置的移转 同时我对使用这台车上的法律权利也起了变化 所以我在试着造成世上的某种变化 仅凭说出这些话 你能把车借我吗 

这样的事一直在发生 来看另一个例子下面再举另一个例子 

假设我有一个朋友 想知道今晚是否是满月 我说 是满月 我说这句话难道只是为了从嘴里呼出热气吗 不是的 我说这句话仅仅是为了表达我个人的看法吗 不是的 我在试着告诉朋友某件事 我在试着改变朋友的看法 这就会在世界上引起某种效果 这就是交流行为 即是在世界上引起告诉朋友某件事的效果 告知是一种交流行为 几乎所有言语行为都有相关的特定效果 当你提问时 你想要得到对方的回答 当你道歉时 当你承诺时 你想要得到对方的信任 相信你会做到你所承诺的事 所以言语行为常常伴随着特定效果 这些效果是行为者有意引起的 这种意图引起效果的行为就是交流行为 所以如果我们想要正式定义交流行为 可以说交流行为就是 引起预期的效果 也就是 也就是行为者在进行的那种言语行为时应带来的效果 这就是交流行为 既然交流行为是 引起应有的效果 效果效果不发生 交流行为也就不会发生 这看上去很奇怪 因为你将要采取何种行为 端视效果是否会发生 也许几秒之后 也许是在更远的将来（原文多出一组even longer） 但如何你仔细思考就不会觉得奇怪了 因为如果你对着一个人扣下扳机 那么你的行为是否算杀人 要看对方是否死亡 这个人的死亡是一种独立的结果 这种效果可能会经过相当长的时间才发生 但是直到这个人死去之前 你的行为都不算杀人 这就是对交流行为的描述 除非效果发生 否则你的行为就不是交流行为 它必须是预期的效果 即是你在进行的言语行为应产生的效果 麻烦之处在于 我们要如何引起这些效果 因为这并不容易 

想想别人怎样引起效果 想想面包师做面包的情景 面包师需要整合正确的原料 放在正确的位置 使用正确的数量 如果一个面包师把面粉撒得满厨房都是 那就没有剩余的空间来做蛋糕了 使用正确的原料 意味着 如果他用了砂砾而非面粉 就做不成蛋糕了 并且他必须以正确方式整合原料 例如顺序要正确 你不能以错误的顺序来混合它们 这样蛋糕会做不成 并且需要用正确的时间来烘烤它 等等等等 所以关于如何做出一个好蛋糕的效果 有许多麻烦的规则 同样的道理也适用于交流行为 需要遵守规则 才能引起你想要的交流行为 在这种情况下 即是取得言语行为的预期效果 同样的规则适用于任何理性之人想要取得任何目标的情况 每当你想要引起某种效果 你就需要遵循某种普遍规则 它同样也适用于想要用语言引起效果的人 即是想要进行交流行为的人 如果你想要告知别人 影响他们的看法  那么你需要以特定方式来说话 如果你想要承诺别人 使他们信任你 这就是一种与承诺的言语行为 有关的交流行为 但除非你遵守特定规则 他们不会信任你 所以我们要搞清楚的是这些语言的规则 它们使我们能够引起这些效果 而这些效果就是交流行为 保罗·格莱斯 (Paul Grice) 帮助我们解决了这个问题 他是20世纪的伟大哲学家之一 他设置了一系列规则来规范交流行为 他称这些为 交流格言 我们将要逐条阅读 格莱斯关注人们陈述事物以及相互配合时的语境 人们陈述事物、相互配合以及告知对方时的语境 他并不试图提供一个概括性的理论 所以这是关于相互作用的语境中的表达 

第一句格言与数量有关 它的大意是 不要说得太多 多过你想要实现的目标所需 如果你说得太多 重点将会失焦 所以你说的话 不能超过得到目标所需要的 数量规则的第二部分是你不能说得太少 对吧? 因为如果你说得不够 容易造成误导 而且难以实现你的目标 因为你的交谈对象并未掌握他们需要知道的所有信息 

第二条规则是关于质量 质量规则是 不要说连你自己都不信的话 不要说谎 不要误导 不要欺骗 对吧? 质量规则的第二部分是 不要说一些你不足以为其辩护的话 因为你不该不假思索就脱口而出 却没有相信你自己所说的话的理由 这些都是常识性的规则 但它们不够显而易见 直到格莱斯系统性地阐述 第三条规则是关联性规则 它是最困难的 关联性规则是指要说相关的话 看 它很短 我承认 它很易于记忆 我也承认 但使用好这条规则是很麻烦的 因为你必须想出什么是相关的 讨论一些关于它的问题 但现在你只要记住它其实很显而易见 当你在谈论一个主题时 你想要达到特定目标 你的交谈对象正在配合你 就像格莱斯假设的一样 那么你就应该谈论相关的事物 如果你改变了话题 那将会产生误导 第四条交流格言是态度规则 它是指说话要简洁 要有条理 不要晦涩 不要含糊 很简单 都是关于文体 因为如果你不够简洁 人们不会注意 如果不够有条理 人们会感到困惑 如果你说话含含糊糊 又有歧义 别人大概就听不懂你要说什么 所以 当人们在互相交流的时候 要遵从这四项原则 当人们并不是真正在交流 而是在欺骗 愚弄别人时 就会违背这些原则 然后误导别人 但如果人们想好好谈话 就会遵从这些规矩 同时也能通过违背这些原则来欺骗他人 注意 我说的这些规则对你来说不一定百分之一万适用 你大概以前从未想过这些问题 但现在一旦提起 又觉得它们是很显然的事 就好像之前提到的手指和歌手的例子 爸和妈 两个字是同韵的 那是你从没思考过的规则 然而一旦指出 又觉得它好像很明显 格莱斯就是这么做的 他为我们展现了规范交流行为的规则 让我们能够利用话语达到特定目的 这样我们就能运用这些规则理解许多对话中隐含的意思 假设你在一家餐馆里 侍者走到你的桌子边上说 甜点有蛋糕或者冰激凌 

嗯 他是什么意思呢？ 他的意思是你要么点蛋糕 要么点冰激凌 他没说他们供应派 所以你不能点派 因为要是他是个好侍者 如果有派供应的话他一定会知道的 那你就能点派 他应该告诉你你有“派”这个选项 如果他说你能点蛋糕 冰激凌 或派 他就违反了数量规则  他没有提供你所有的有关信息 因为你认为他在与你互动 并且会把你想要的东西送上来 这是一个侍者应该做到的 所以就一定没有派可以点 所以尽管你很想吃派 你却会要一份冰激凌  

这就是 会话含义 当侍者告诉你你可以点一份蛋糕或冰激凌时 他就在对话里暗示了你不能点派 他以这种方式来暗示你的原因是 如果他要遵从交流规则或交流格言来进行对话 他就需要提到派这个词 所以你能领会他之所以只说了蛋糕和冰激凌 就是说没派吃 他在对话中暗示了他们不供应派 而你之所以能明白他是什么意思 是听了他说的话 再结合背景知识 比如他的侍者身份 他不会乱说话 也知道餐馆里究竟提供什么 再运用数量规则做一些小小的计算 就能明白 他知道你绝不可能在这儿吃到派 当然因为他是个侍者 所以他知道供应什么 所以你吃不到派啦！（我已经疯了） 那如果在别桌有个他相熟的客人 而他知道现在只剩下一块派了 他不想你抢掉那块派呢？ 

他也会说 你能点蛋糕或冰激凌 他没提派 所以你不会点它 那他的熟客就能吃到派了 他还是在对话中暗示你不能点派 但他骗了你 因为他试图给别人留下这最后一块派 他不愿跟你对话合作 所以如果你想跟别人好好合作对话 你会运用你的常识 告诉他一切 这很棘手 交流规则是可以良好运作的 如果你不想好好对话 你就能误导对方 这就是会话暗示的双刃剑 

但会话暗示有一个特点 对于思辨实在是很重要 那就是 你能取消会话暗示 那个侍者能说 你能点蛋糕或冰激凌 啊 你也能点派 当他说你能点派的时候 他没说你不能点蛋糕或冰激凌 因为你仍旧能点它们 这就是说 你能点派啦 

所以 我们能避免会话暗示 说你能点派 这样你就不会以为你不能点派了 

所以在会话暗示中 如果一个句子P 会话性地暗示了另一个句子Q 那么你可以否认Q 同时承认P为真 

这点很重要 因为它将会话暗示和逻辑蕴涵或逻辑推论区分开来 如果我说艾莉丝是我姐姐 就暗示了艾莉丝是女性 我不能说 艾莉丝是我姐姐 啊 她不是女性 这说不通 因为如果她不是女性 就不可能是我姐姐 这是个逻辑推论或逻辑蕴涵 

但是在会话暗示中 你可以否认在前述会话中暗示的内容 而最初的陈述依然成立 如果侍者说你可以点蛋糕或冰淇淋 而我发现了他是在为另一桌的客人留下最后一块派 我就走到他面前说 等等 你骗了我 他其实并没有撒谎 因为他说的话是真的 我可以点蛋糕或冰淇淋 这依然成立 我能点蛋糕或冰淇淋 他并没有告诉我不实信息 他仅仅是没有提到我可以点派这回事 在会话暗示中这是非常不同的两回事 而在逻辑蕴涵中则不会差别那么大 这对我们来说很重要 尤其是在课程后段我们谈到正式逻辑的时候 我来给你举个更为重要的例子 想象一个政客宣布一个政策 说为了降低犯罪率 要让罪犯从大街上消失 该政策就是把他们都关起来 被怀疑犯了罪的那些人 你可以把他们统统关起来 这就可以使罪犯从大街上消失 

这可能会打动人们 如果他们没有注意到他省略了一个事实 那就是他不只是想使罪犯从大街上消失 还有许多其他人  还有许多其他人也会消失 他没有告诉你全部的有关信息 就像那个侍者一样 他暗示该项政策将解决犯罪问题 通过把犯下罪行的人们关进监狱 只是省略了一个有关事实 就是同时也将许多其他人一起关进监狱 所以他在会话中暗示不必考虑其他有关事实 只提到该政策会降低犯罪率 你需要善于观察这种暗示 并且发问 说得对 但他还有什么是省略掉的？ 你常常需要做这件事 以免被卑鄙的政客或其他人误导 他们故意省略了谈话中的有关信息 当然了 政客也许不在乎是否误导了你 这正是他的目的 他想要说服你 不管是否有误导 因为他感兴趣的是劝说而不是证明 

除了 Glyphicons 之外 他已经准备好了防御措施 他可以说 我没有说任何不实的话 我说的都是真话 如果我们把那些潜在的罪犯关进牢里就能降低犯罪率 也许有些无辜的人也会被关进牢里 但犯罪率会降低 这就是我所说的 格莱斯的数量规则在于 我们批评这个政客的原因 我们说他没有在真正对话 因为他没有遵守交流的数量规则 他没有给出我们所需的全部有关信息 来达到我们的目标 假设我们的确有一个共同目标 他是在假装跟我们有一个共同目标 即国家的福祉 其实他并没有 他只是想要赢得选举 

所以格莱斯赋予我们一种洞察力 来弄清这些误导了我们的语句 以及回应这些不好的论证 会话暗示和逻辑蕴涵之间的区别 对论证来说至关重要 因为它告诉我们该如何反驳论证 如果你不喜欢一个论证的前提 因为它有误导性 因为它会话性地暗示了一些错误信息 说明这个前提本身是错误的并不是一个好方法 为了证明它的错误 你必须证明它的逻辑蕴含出了错 然后你就能推断这个前提本身就是错的 之后当我们看到论证中的会话暗示和逻辑蕴涵时 这点会变得相当重要 但现在 重要的是 理解充分条件和必要条件 之间的区别 行为人在说话 或互动时 通常会遵守格莱斯表明的这些交流规则 但他们也不是一直遵守 有时也会违背它们 当然了 如往常一样 交流行为还有很多需要说明的 如果你想要学习更多关于交流行为的知识 你可以阅读参考书《理解论证》中关于本节课的一些章节 

但我要 我认为我们已经学习到足够多关于交流行为的知识 可以进行下一段了 目前为止我们已经学过了所有的语言层面 包括语义层面 言语行为层面 以及交流行为层面 现在我们将结合这些课程 更加具体地运用到论证语言中 这就是论证中使用的特定语言类型 这就是接下来几节课将要讨论的主题
