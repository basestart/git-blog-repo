# Welcome to the Course

Welcome to Think Again: How to Reason Deductively! This course is the second in a series of four courses jointly titled Think Again: How to Reason and Argue. We are excited that you are taking this course, and we hope that you will stick around for all four courses in the series, because there is a great deal of important material to learn.In the series as a whole, you will learn how to evaluate deductive arguments.

What is it for a deductive to be “valid”? And how can you tell the difference between deductive arguments that are valid and those that aren’t? In this course, we will answer these questions.

The first part of this course introduces the series and the course. It also clarifies some peculiarities you may find with this course. We encourage you to watch the "Introduction to the Course" video first as it will help you learn more from the materials that come later.

## Introduction

Hi. I'm Walter Sinnott-Armstrong from Duke University. And I'm Ram Neta from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Three years ago, Ram and I constructed a Coursera course called, Think Again. It taught students how to analyze and evaluate arguments. It taught them how to tell the difference between good reasoning and bad reasoning. Over the last three years, we've had a wonderful time teaching Think Again and we've really enjoyed interacting in the discussion forums with students from all over the world. We were extremely pleased with the reaction to our course. Over the past three years, over 750,000 students enrolled in that course. But, we realized that we could teach the course even more effectively if we made a few small changes. First, it wasn't easy to cover all the material that we wanted to cover in the 12 weeks of our course. Each week contained hours of lecture, exercises, and quizzes. And doing all those hours of work every week for 12 weeks was a tall order. In the third week of each section of that old course, we asked you to learn new material and then also take a quiz. Well, that's just too much. For these reasons, we decided that the best way for students to learn all of the material that we wanted to teach them was to divide up our original course into four much shorter courses. That way, you can take one of the courses, take off a month or two, take another course, maybe skip a course, we hope you won't, but do it at your own pace in the way that fits your lifestyle best. And that way, you're most likely to end up learning all of the material that we want you to learn. Maybe not this year, but eventually. And the material really does fit together. So even though we've split up the course into four separate courses, it's very worthwhile for you to take all the different courses if you possibly can. The lectures in the mini course that you're about to take now, were all part of our original 12 week course. And so frequently, you're going to find that we make references in those lectures to other features of that original 12 week course. For example, very early on I say, that arguments have a form or a structure and that we'll study that form or structure in future weeks in the course. Well, now that's in the second course, the course on deductive logic. And I begin the course in deductive logic by saying, welcome to unit two of our course. Well, I was referring to unit two of our original 12 week course. But now, deductive logic is its own course. And when I talk about weeks four and five, I'm referring to weeks four and five of our original 12 week course. But now, they're weeks one and two of the deductive logic course. We hope this is not too confusing but the basic message is really simple. Just ignore all of those cross-references to other parts of courses or other courses, just the same way that you ignore the wrinkles on an old road map. Hey, I like to use wrinkled road maps. Well, it's fine to use wrinkled road maps as long as you know the wrinkles aren't extra roads because then you're going to drive off onto them. So you're saying that the students can learn all the material that we want to teach them even if they ignore all of our references to the old 12 week course? Exactly. Sounds like a plan to me. We hope that you enjoy taking this mini course just as much as we enjoyed making it. And we hope that it encourages you to take the other courses in our Think Again sequence. And also to encourage your friends and family to take this series of courses as well, because it's a lot more fun to take these courses together with other people so that you can talk to them about the arguments you'll be studying. Thank you for listening. 

### course logistics

Welcome to Think Again: How to Reason Deductively! This course is the second in a series of four courses titled Think Again: How to Reason and Argue. We are excited that you are taking this course, and we hope that you will stick around for all four courses in the series, because there is a great deal of important material to learn.

In the series as a whole, you will learn how to evaluate deductive arguments. What is it for a deductive to be “valid”?And how can you tell the difference between deductive arguments that are valid and those that aren’t?In this course, we will answer these questions.

This course will contain lectures, ungraded exercises, and one final quiz that will count towards the certificate, if you choose.

LECTURES: Each week will consist of a set of modules that will contain a series of short lectures along with practice quizzes. The topics are described in the syllabus on the course website and at the beginning of each week.

EXERCISES: Throughout the course you will find a series of exercises in the form of practice quizzes. The point of the exercises is only to make sure that you understand the material in the corresponding lecture. They are not intended to be difficult. If you miss too many of these exercises and if you do not understand the explanations of the answers that we provide, then it might be a good idea to listen again to the relevant lecture before proceeding to the next lecture. All of these exercises are ungraded and optional, but we hope that they will help you learn more. If you have trouble with the exercise, then you should post your questions on the discussion forums. If you do not have trouble, please go into the discussion forums and help your fellow students with their questions. The best way to learn is to teach. In the previous runs of this course, many students were extremely good at explaining these exercises to other students. We and our teaching assistants will also check the forums occasionally in order to provide additional assistance.

FINAL QUIZ: The final quiz at the end of the course will contain questions similar to the exercises. You may take the quiz as many times as you want in order to pass, with different questions each time. You will be able to retake the quiz three times every eight hours. We will provide explanations of all of the answers in each quiz so that you can check those explanations before trying the quiz again.

TEXTBOOK: We suggest that you obtain and read the recommended textbook: Understanding Arguments, Ninth Edition, Concise Version, by Walter Sinnott-Armstrong and Robert Fogelin. Chapters 6-7 are relevant to this second course. This textbook is not required in order to do well in this course or the other courses in this series, but it will probably help you by providing more examples, exercises, and explanations. You can buy a paperback or electronic copy here, if you like:

Link to buy Understanding Arguments, Ninth Edition, Concise Version

WORKLOAD: For each weeks worth of material, you should expect to spend on average roughly 2 hours watching the lectures, another 2 hours doing the exercises, another hour per week reading the textbook (which is optional), and about 1 hour each time you take the final quiz. Some students spend more time, and some spend less. The amount of time you spend is entirely up to you. The more time you spend, the more you will learn.

FORUMS: The best way to learn about arguments is to practice constructing your own arguments and analyzing arguments given by other people, especially people with whom you disagree. We provide opportunities for such exchanges in the discussion forums, which are also places to find answers to your questions, new examples, and stimulating discussions of various issues with fellow students from around the world.

Special Discussion Forums can also be used to set up study groups, give feedback on course material, seek help with technical difficulties, and tell us and other students about yourself. Please be polite when using these forums. You will be able to vote up or down posts in these forums so that the most useful posts will rise to the top and be seen first.

EMAIL POLICY: Please do NOT email the professors. Unfortunately, it will not be possible for us respond. We wish we could, but there are simply too many students for us to be able to reply to individual emails. Thanks for understanding.

SPREAD THE WORD: You will get more out of this course if you share the adventure, so we suggest that you encourage your friends, relatives, neighbors, or colleagues to take the course with you.

We hope that you are looking forward to the course. We are.

Let’s get going!

# Propositional Logic and Truth Tables

CONTENT: This week we will teach you how such phrases as “and”, “or”, “if”, and “not” can work to guarantee the validity or invalidity of the deductive arguments in which they occur. It will also teach you to understand the functioning of these phrases using a device called a “truth-table”, which shows how the truth or falsity of propositions that use these phrases depends upon the truth or falsity of the propositions contained within it. We highly recommend that you practice the skills that you will learn in this week by doing the puzzles at betapuzzle.sonjara.com.

LEARNING OUTCOMES: By the end of this week’s material you will be able to :

define what a deductive argument is
define what it is for a deductive argument to be valid
identify truth-functional operators and connectives
build a truth-table for any truth-functional operator or connective
OPTIONAL READING: If you want more examples or more detailed discussions of these topics, we recommend Understanding Arguments, Ninth Edition, Chapter 6.

## Deductive Logic

### introduction to deductive logic

Welcome to the second unit of our course. In the first unit of the course, you learned how to listen to what someone was saying, or read what they wrote and separate out the arguments that they were giving from the rest of their words. You learned what arguments are, what their parts are, and how those parts work together to achieve the various purposes of argument. 

Now in this second unit of the course, and the third unit that follows it, you'll learn some rules for evaluating the success of arguments. In particular in the second unit of the course, we'll focus on rules for evaluating the validity of deductive arguments. And then in the third unit of the course, we'll focus on rules for evaluating the strength of inductive arguments. Recall that deductive arguments are arguments that are presented as being valid, and they are successful only if they're valid. Inductive arguments, in contrast, are arguments that are not presented as being valid. They're presented as being strong, and they're successful only to the extent that they are strong. 

Okay, now since in this second unit of the course we're focusing on rules for evaluating the validity of deductive arguments, let me say a bit more now about validity and about the rules for assessing validity. 

See, I just got a new pet clownfish, Nimo. 

Now maybe you don't know much about clown fish anatomy, 

but I'm going to try to persuade you right now that clown fish have gills. 

Here's an argument that I could give you for the conclusion that clownfish have gills. 

Well, catfish have gills, goldfish have gills and sharks have gills. Therefore, clownfish have gills. 

Now, is that argument valid? 

No, it's not. 

It's not valid because it's possible for the premises to be true even when the conclusion is false. It could be that catfish and sharks and goldfish all have gills, even though clownfish don't. 

But now suppose I give you a different argument for the conclusion that clown fish have gills. 

Here's how this different argument goes. All fish have gills. Clown fish are a kind of fish. Therefore, clownfish have gills. 

Now, that argument is valid. There's no possible way for the premises of that argument to be true if the conclusion is false. Recall that in the first unit of the course, Walter defined validity as follows. He said that an argument is valid if there is no possible way for all the premises of the argument to be true while the conclusion is false. And he gave an example of an argument that was valid. The example, recall, went like this. Premise one, Mary has a child who is pregnant. 

Premise two, only daughters can become pregnant. 

Therefore, conclusion, Mary has at least one daughter. 

Now remember, as Walter pointed out, you can imagine situations where the first premise is false. Maybe Mary doesn't have a child who was pregnant. You can imagine situations in which the second premise is false. Maybe not only daughters can become pregnant, maybe there's some way for sons to become pregnant, or maybe there's some way for children from some third gender or some unspecified gender to become pregnant. 

And you can imagine a situation which the conclusion is false, in which Mary doesn't have at least one daughter. But what you can't imagine, what's completely incoherent, what's completely impossible is for there to be a situation in which both of the premises are true, and the conclusion is false. 

In any possible situation, either the premises, in any possible situation in which the premises are true, the conclusion has to be true. 

There's no possible situation for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. 

So that's what makes that argument valid. 

Now what I'd like to do right now is show that there are other arguments that have the same form as this first argument about Mary and are valid for what seems to be the same reason as the argument about Mary is valid, even though they have a completely different subject matter. 

So here's another example, consider the following argument. Premise one, Terry has a job in which she arrests people. 

Premise two, only police officers can arrest people. 

Therefore, conclusion, at least one of Terry's jobs is as a police officer. 

Now again. 

Maybe, premise one of this argument is false. You can certainly imagine that it's false, right? Maybe Terry doesn't have a job in which she arrests people. Maybe premise two of the argument is false, you can imagine a situation which not only police officers can arrest people. Maybe there's a world in which police officers, and judges, and plumbers, and actors can all arrest people. 

And, of course, you can imagine a situation which the conclusion is false, in which it's not true that at least one of Terry's jobs is as a police officer. 

But what you can't imagine, what's completely impossible, is that both of the premises of that argument are true and the conclusion is false. If both of the premises of that argument about Terry are true, the conclusion has to be true, and so the argument is valid. The argument about Terry is valid, just as the argument about Mary is valid. 

And notice the two arguments have completely different subject matters. The first is about Mary's children, the second is about Terry's jobs. 

But even though they have completely different subject matters, they have something in common. There seems to be something in common to their form. Something signaled by their use of the terms only and at least. 

Something in common to the two arguments that explains why they're valid. 

To get at what this common feature is a bit more clearly, let me give a third and final example of this form. Let's see if you get the idea. 

So consider the following argument. Premise one, Robert has a pet who is canine. 

Premise two, only mammals can be canine. So conclusion, Robert has at least one pet who is mammal. 

Now, of course you can imagine a situation in which premise one is false. Maybe Robert doesn't have any canine pets. You can imagine a situation which premise two is false. In which not only mammals are canine, maybe some canines are reptiles, or some canines are robots, or who knows. 

And of course you can imagine a situation where the conclusion is false, in which Robert doesn't have any mammal pets. Maybe all of his pets are birds or reptiles, or maybe he doesn't have any pets. But in any case, you can imagine these possibilities. But what you cannot imagine, what's completely ruled out, is the possibility that the premises of that argument are true and the conclusion is false. If the premises of the argument are true, the conclusion has got to be true. And so this argument about Robert is also valid, just like the arguments about Mary and Terry were valid. 

But of course this argument about Robert has a completely different subject matter than the arguments about Mary or Terry. One was an argument about Mary's children, the other was an argument about Terry's jobs and this is an argument about Robert's pets. 

Completely different subject matters, but they're all valid, and it seems they're all valid for the same reason. They have the same form, and it's a form that's signaled by their use of the phrases only and at least. 

So what we'll be doing in the second unit of the course is studying the forms of valid argument. The forms that explain why valid arguments are valid. 

Now in the arguments that we just looked at, the arguments about Mary, Terry, and Robert, their common form, I said, involved the use of the word only and it also involved the use of the phrase at least. 

Only and at least are both phrases that we're going to call quantifiers. 

And next week, in week five of the course, when we study the subject that we're going to call categorical logic, we're going to be studying in particular quantifiers like only, at least, some, all, none, and phrases like that. And we're going to be studying how the use of phrases like that, the use of quantifiers, can make arguments valid no matter what those arguments are about. If the arguments use quantifiers like only, at least, some, all and none in certain ways, then those arguments are going to be valid regardless of their subject matter. 

But this week, in week four, we're not going to be studying quantifiers like only or at least, instead we're going to be studying a kind of phrase that we're going to call a propositional connective. In particular, a kind of propositional connective that we'll call a truth-functional connective. So what are propositional connectives? What are truth-functional connectives? How do they work to make arguments valid? Those questions and more, we'll address in the next lecture. 

### propersitions and propositional connectives

This week we're going to be studying propositional logic, which is the rules that determine the validity of an argument based on the propositional connectives that are used in that argument. Now I've said a little bit about propositional connectives, but in order to say more about what propositional connectives are, in particular, in order to give the definition of propositional connectives, I have to start out by giving a definition of propositions. So what are propositions? A proposition is the kind of thing that can be true or false and that can be the premise or the conclusion of an argument. 

Let me give you some examples to illustrate that definition. 

See these binoculars? These binoculars are not a proposition. They can't be true or false, and they can't be the premise or the conclusion of an argument. 

See this hand? This hand is not a proposition. 

This hand cannot be true or false, and it can't be the premise or the conclusion of an argument. But now suppose I say the binoculars are in my hand. Now what I just said, that the binoculars are in my hand, that is the kind of thing that can be true or false. For instance, right now it's true, and right now it's false. 

It's also the kind of thing that could be the premise or the conclusion of an argument. For instance, I could say the binoculars are in my hand. Therefore, my hand is not free to shake yours. 

Or I could say, you just gave me the binoculars and I haven't let go of them. Therefore, the binoculars are in my hand. >> See? So that the binoculars are in my hand, that's a proposition. That's the kind of thing that can be true or false, and that can be the premise or the conclusion of an argument. 

Now, now that we know what propositions are, what's a propositional connective? A propositional connective is something that takes propositions and connects them to create new propositions. 

For instance, sometimes, in English, the word and can work as a propositional connective. 

So let me give you an example of how, in English, the word and can sometimes function as a propositional connective. 

So consider the proposition I'm holding the binoculars. That's a proposition. It's the kind of thing that can be true or false, and it's the kind of thing that can be the premise or the conclusion of an argument. Well, there's also the proposition I'm looking through the binoculars, right? That's the kind of thing that can be true or false, and it's the kind of thing that can be the premise or the conclusion of an argument. Well, you could use the word and to connect up those two propositions to make a new proposition. The new proposition would be I'm holding the binoculars and looking through them. 

See, now that's a proposition. It's the kind of thing that can be true or false, and it's also the kind of thing that could be the premise or the conclusion of an argument. For instance, right now it's true that I'm holding the binoculars and looking through them, whereas right now it's false that I'm holding the binoculars and looking through them. 

I could say, what you're seeing right now is really happening. Therefore, I'm holding the binoculars and looking through them. 

Or I could say, I'm holding the binoculars and looking through them. Therefore, I should not be driving a car right now. 

You see? So that I'm holding the binoculars and looking through them is also a proposition. It's the kind of thing that can be true or false, and it's the kind of thing that can be the premise or the conclusion of an argument. 

But it's a proposition that we created by combining two other propositions, namely the proposition I'm holding the binoculars and the proposition I'm looking through the binoculars, by combining those two propositions with the word and. So that's an example of how the word and, in English, can work as a propositional connective, connecting two propositions into a third proposition. 

### 'and' and the truthfunctional connectives

Now I just said that in English, the word and functions as a propositional connective. But it doesn't always function that way, even in English. For instance, think about a sentence that uses the word and like the sentence, Jack and Jill finally talked. 

I can think of at least three different interpretations of that sentence, three different things that that sentence could mean. And corresponding to those three different things that the sentence could mean, three different ways that the word and is getting used in that sentence. So here's one thing the sentence could mean. Jack and Jill could be a name of a particular entity, let's say a fast food company, there could be a fast food company called Jack and Jill. Or maybe Jack and Jill the fast food company makes some kind of special stew. And lawyers have been asking Jack and Jill to disclose the ingredients of the special stew because they find that a lot of the customers who eat this stew have been getting sick recently. So lawyers are asking Jack and Jill to disclose the ingredients and Jack and Jill refuses to do so until finally the spokesperson for Jack and Jill holds a press conference in which he discloses the ingredients of the special stew. 

I might describe that situation by saying Jack and Jill finally talked. What I mean there is that there's a particular entity, namely the company, Jack and Jill. And that company finally talked through its spokesperson. Finally disclosed the ingredients of its special stew through its spokesperson. 

Now, on that interpretation of the sentence, Jack and Jill finally talked, the word and is not being used as a propositional connective. It's not connecting two propositions and forming a larger proposition out of those two smaller propositions. 

Here's another way of understanding the sentence Jack and Jill finally talked. 

Let's suppose Jack, Jill, and Roger are having a silence contest to see who among the three of them can be silent the longest. And all three of them are silent for a long period of time and while I'm watching the silence contest, you're calling in to me periodically to find out if anyone of these three contestants finally talked. 

And finally, at one point, you call in and you say okay, has anyone talked yet? And I say well, Jack and Jill finally talked, so Roger won the competition. Now, there in that sentence, when I say Jack and Jill finally talked, the word and is being used as a propositional connective, what I'm saying in effect is that Jack finally talked and Jill finally talked. So there are two propositions that I'm trying to communicate. The proposition Jack finally talked, and the proposition Jill finally talked, and I'm using the word and to connect those two propositions into a larger proposition Jack and Jill finally talked. And so Roger won the competition. There the word and is being used as a propositional connective. It's just connecting the proposition Jack finally talked and the proposition Jill finally talked to form a larger proposition, Jack and Jill finally talked. 

And there's a third way that the word and could get used just in that sentence Jack and Jill finally talked. Suppose Jack and Jill are a couple and recently they've been having a tough time. They've been angry and resentful, and they haven't been talking to each other about the sources of their anger and resentment. Well suppose they decide that they're going to finally get their grievances out into the open, they're going to talk to each other. Then I might say, Jack and Jill finally talked. Now, there, when I use the word and, I'm not just connecting the proposition, Jack finally talked and Jill finally talked. What I'm trying to communicate is not just that each of them talked, I'm trying to communicate that each of them talked to the other. I'm trying to say that they talked to each other. 

So there in that third interpretation the word and is not working just as a propositional connective. It's not just connecting the proposition that Jack finally talked and the proposition Jill finally talked, because I'm trying to get across something more than just that Jack finally talked and Jill finally talked. I'm also trying to get across the point that they talked to each other. 

That's what I'm trying to communicate there with the sentence Jack and Jill finally talked. 
4:40
So, there the word and is not being used as a propositional connective. 

So I hope I've made it clear that the word and can get used in a bunch of different ways in English. 

One of the ways it can get used is as a propositional connective, to connect two propositions into a larger proposition. But that's not the only way it can get used. It can get used in other ways as well. I've tried to give examples of those just now. What we're going to be concerned about here is just the use of and as a propositional connective. And then we'll look at other expressions in English, like or, not, but, only, if, and so forth, that also get used as propositional connectives. We'll look at those, and see how those work. 

Okay, so now let's consider the propositional connective and. 

Notice though that even when the word and is being used as a propositional connective, it can still get used in different ways. For instance, suppose I say, I took a shower and got dressed. Well there, and is being used as a propositional connective. It's connecting two propositions. The proposition I took a shower, and the proposition I got dressed. It is connecting those into a larger proposition, I took a shower and got dressed. 

But there, the word and is being used to convey a sense of temporal ordering, a sense of time. The idea is, when I say I took a shower and got dressed, the idea is I first took a shower and then got dressed, right? It wouldn't mean the same thing if I said I got dressed and took a shower. 

But sometimes when the word and is being used as a propositional connective, there's no suggestion of temporal ordering. So for instance, if I say I'm holding the binoculars and looking through them, there's no suggestion that I'm doing one first and then the other. I'm just doing both, I'm holding them and looking through them. There's no suggestion that one is happening before the other. 

Now in that second usage, when the word and doesn't convey any kind of temporal ordering. Where it just combines two propositions into a larger proposition without conveying any sense of temporal ordering, then I'll say the word and is not just functioning as a propositional connective, but it's functioning as what I'll call a truth-functional connective. 

So what's a truth-functional connective? A truth-functional connective is a propositional connective 

that creates new propositions whose truth or falsity depends on nothing other than the truth or falsity of the propositions that went into creating them. 

Let me give you some examples to illustrate that definition. So consider again, our example Jack and Jill finally talked. Where that used to just that Jack finally talked and that Jill finally talked. Okay, so when is that proposition going to be true? When is it going to be true that Jack and Jill finally talked? 

Well, that's going to be true. Whenever it's true that Jack finally talked and Jill finally talked. As long as those two conditions are true, as long as Jack finally talked, and Jill finally talked, it's also going to be true that Jack and Jill finally talked. 

So if it's not true that Jack finally talked, than it won't be true that Jack and Jill finally talked. If it's not true that Jill finally talked, then it won't be true that Jack and Jill finally talked. But as long as it is true, that Jack finally talked and that Jill finally talked, it will be true that Jack and Jill finally talked. 

So that use of and is a use of and as a truth-functional connective, because it creates a new proposition, Jack and Jill finally talked. The truth or falsity of which depends on nothing other than the truth or falsity of the two propositions that it connects. 

There are lots of other examples. So for instance, consider the use of and as a truth-functional connective in the proposition. I'm holding the binoculars and looking through them. Again, when is that proposition going to be true? It's going to be true only in these cases where it's true that I'm holding my binoculars, and it's also true that I'm looking through my binoculars. 

If both of those are true, then the whole proposition, I'm holding my binoculars and looking through them, will also be true. If either one of those initial propositions is false, if it's false that I'm holding the binoculars or if it's false that I'm looking through the binoculars. Then the whole proposition, I'm holding the binoculars and looking though them, will also be false. So there again, the truth or falsity of the whole proposition depends on nothing other than the truth or falsity of the propositions that go into creating it using the truth functional connective and. And that's what shows that and in that usage is a truth functional connective. It's that the proposition that it creates by joining other propositions is a proposition whose truth or falsity depends on nothing other than the truth or falsity of the ingredient propositions that went into creating it. That's a truth-functional connective. Now in week four, this week on propositional logic, we're going to be studying truth functional connectives, and how the use of truth functional connectives in argument can make those arguments valid no matter what those arguments are about. Now, let's move to some examples. 

### using truth tables to show validatity

In the last lecture, we learned about the truth functional connective that we call conjunction. The truth functional connective that, in English at least, is sometimes expressed by certain uses of the word and. 

And we learned about the truth table for conjunction. Now, one thing I'd like to do in today's lecture is show how we can use the truth table for conjunction. To show that certain kinds of inferences that use conjunction are going to be valid. Let me give you an example. Consider an inference that starts off with two premises, doesn't matter what the premises are, just any two premises, call them P and Q. because it doesn't matter what they are. And then the conclusion of the inference is simply going to be the conjunction of those two premises, whatever they were. 

So the inference can be sketched as follows, P, Q, conclusion P and Q. Now we can call that a conjunction introduction inference, because the conclusion of the inference uses a conjunction. It introduces a conjunction that wasn't present in either of the two premisses of the inference. Now, notice if you look at the first line of the truth table for conjunction, you can see that any conjunction introduction inference is going to have to be valid. Here's how you can see that. If you look at the the first line of the truth table for conjunction, that considers the situation in which P is true and Q is true. And in any such situation, according to that truth table, the conjunction P and Q is going to have to be true. 

Now, let's take that point and apply it to the inference from the premise P and the premise Q, to the conclusion P and Q. 

What does that first line of the truth table for conjunction tell you about that inference? Well, it tells you that in any situation in which the premises of that inference, P and Q, are both true in any situation in which those premises are both true, the conclusion, P and Q, is going to have to be true. 

But that's just what it is for the inference to be valid. Recall that for an inference to be valid is just for it to be such that there is no possible situation, where the premises are true and the conclusion is false. 

So from the first line of the truth table for conjunction, you can see that conjunction introduction inferences are all going to be valid. 

You could also see, by looking at the truth table for conjunction that another kind of inference is always going to be valid. So, consider an inference that starts with only one premise. A premise that conjoin's two propositions. Again, never mind what the two propositions are. They could be anything. Call them P & Q. because it doesn't matter what they are. So consider an argument that starts with that one premise, P&Q, and it moves to a conclusion that consists simply of one of those two propositions that is conjoined in the premise. So the conclusion of the argument will be either the proposition P or the proposition Q. 

Now an argument like that we can call an conjunction elimination argument, because the conclusion of the argument eliminates a conjunction that occurs in the premise of the argument. Right? The premise is a conjunction of two propositions, P & Q. And the conclusion is simply one of those two propositions, not conjoint to anything else. So the conclusion is either the proposition P or it's a proposition Q. 

Now, is that argument going to be valid? Well, if you look at the truth table for conjunction, you'll see that it is going to be valid. In any possible situation, in which of the premise of that argument P and Q is true. 

Both of the two propositions that are conjoined in that premise, both the proposition P and the proposition Q, are also going to be true. 

>> So any situation in which the premise of a conjunctional elimination argument is true, is going to be a situation in which the conclusion of that conjunctional elimination argument is true. 

>> Therefore, all conjunction elimination arguments are valid, no matter what they're about. 

And we can see that just by looking at the truth table for conjunction. 

Now, conjunction introduction and conjunction elimination arguments are not the most interesting kinds of arguments there are to be sure. But I just wanted to give a simple example for now of how we can use the truth table for a truth functional connective. In this case the truth functional connective conjunction. How we can use the truth table for that connective to discover that certain kinds of arguments are going to be valid. In the next lecture, we'll show how we can use other kinds of truth tables for other connectives, for other true functional connectives to show that certain other kinds of arguments are valid. See you next time. 

### rules variables and generality

In the last lecture, we saw how the word and in English can sometimes be used to express the truth functional connective conjunction. And we defined conjunction by means of the truth table for conjunction. Now you'll notice in the last version of the truth table that was presented in the last lecture. 

The propositions that were conjoined in that truth table were called p and q. Now you might wonder, what's up with calling propositions p and q? Why are we using letters to refer to propositions? Is this some kind of strange algebra? 

Well today's lecture answers that question. Today's lecture is about variables like the variables that occur in algebra. And similar variables that occur in deductive logic, in the study of the rules for valid argument, which is exactly what unit two is about. 

So, let's begin by talking about rules and why we use variables when we state rules. 

The first point to make about rules is that rules are general. 

We're also designed to apply to many different possible cases. So, for instance, if I say to one of my kids, stop hitting your brother right now. 

Well that's not a rule, that's a command, right? I'm telling one of my kids, stop hitting your brother right now. But it's not a rule. It's not general. It doesn't apply to many different possible people. It doesn't apply to many different possible situations. I'm just telling someone what to do, or in this case what not to do. 

But if I said you should never under any circumstances hit another person, well now that's a rule. It's inherently general. It applies to many different possible situations and many different possible people. 

So is, you should never hit your brother. That's also a rule, because again, it applies to many different possible situations. 

So rules are general. 

But commands may or may not be general. 

So how can we express the generality of a rule? 

Well notice, if I say something that's not general. If I say to one of my kids, stop hitting your brother right now, well, I'm using the expression right now to indicate that my order, my command applies to a particular situation, namely the situation that we're in right now when I issued the order. 

But if I say you should never under any circumstances hit another person. 

I'm using the pronoun you and the expression never under any circumstances to indicate that the rule that I'm stating applies to a multitude of possible situations. In fact, the pronoun you, although it's a second person pronoun, it needn't be understood as referring merely to the person I'm addressing. It could be understood quite generally. 

Think about the ten commandments, thou shalt not kill. Thou is an archaic form of the second person singular, you. 

Or in French, tu. 

So, in those commandments, the second person pronoun is used not to refer to the specific person, to some specific person addressed by the commandment, but to refer to anyone at all. You, whoever you are should not kill. 

And notice, generality comes in degrees. And rules can be more or less general. 

So I could say, you should never under any circumstances hit another person. Well that's a general rule. 

But I could state a rule that's even more general than that. I could say, you should never under any circumstances do violence to another person. Now that's more general, because I'm not just prohibiting hitting, I'm prohibiting any kind of violence, whether it's hitting, kicking, biting, smacking, slapping. I could make a rule that's even more general than that. I could say you should never under any circumstances do something unkind 

to another person, whether the unkind thing in question is a form of violence or merely an insulting action, a demeaning action, a condescending action. There are lots of different ways of doing things that are unkind, even if they're not violent. 

So here, we have rules of different levels of generality. 

If I say, Walter should not force his dog to kill his cat. I'm saying something that has some generality to it. Presumably, what I'm saying doesn't simply apply to the present moment, but it applies more generally to a multitude of moments, not just the present, but maybe the recent past, maybe the near future. 

But of course, I can say something even more general. I could say people should not force creatures to kill innocent creatures. 

That's more general. I'm not just talking about Walter. I'm talking about people quite generally. I'm not just talking about Walter's dog. But I'm talking about creatures quite generally. And I'm not just talking about Walter's cat, I'm talking about innocent creatures, quite generally. And I'm saying that a certain relationship between those three things should not hold. People should not force creatures to kill innocent creatures. 

But now notice, that last sentence is unclear. In particular it has two interpretations, there are two ways of understanding that last sentence. 

We could label them the plural understanding or the distributive understanding. On the plural understanding what I'm saying is that people should not force 

a whole bunch of creatures to kill a bunch of innocent creatures. 

On the distributive interpretation, I'm saying that for any creature that you pick, people should not force that creature to kill an innocent creature. 

So on the first interpretation of the statement, I'm talking about groups of creatures. And on the second interpretation of the statement, I'm talking about each one of a whole bunch of particular creatures. I'm making a statement about each one of those particular creatures, whereas on the first interpretation I'm making a statement about the group of creatures. Now in ordinary language it's not easy to separate out those two interpretations. You can see just in the last minute how hard I had to work in order to distinguish those two interpretations. 

But if we use variables then we can distinguish the two interpretations pretty straightforwardly. We could say in order to specify the distributive interpretation of that statement, we could say where x stand for any creature at all and y stands for any innocent creature at all, people should not force x to kill y. 

So here we're using the variables x and y in order to express the distributive interpretation of people should not force creatures to kill innocent creatures. So variables can be useful to us in clearly expressing certain kinds of distributively interpreted rules. 

Now, in propositional logic variables play an equally useful role. So consider an inference that we looked at in the last lecture from the premise, I'm holding my binoculars and looking through them. 

It follows that I'm holding my binoculars. If it's true that I'm holding my binoculars and looking through them, if that premise is true, then the conclusion, I'm holding my binoculars, must be true. So that right there is a valid deductive argument. There's no possible way for the premise to be true without the conclusion also being true. 

But notice, in that deductive argument, there's nothing special about the proposition I'm holding my binoculars or about the proposition I'm looking through my binoculars. 

In fact for any argument where the premise is the conjunction of two propositions, and the conclusion is one of those two conjoined propositions that argument is also going to be valid, there's also going to be no possible way for the conjunction of the two propositions. That is the premise of that argument, to be true, without the conjoined proposition that is the conclusion of that argument, also being true. In other words, there's not going to be any possible way for the premise to be true while the conclusion is false. 

So any argument of this form right here is going to be valid. 

Now notice in the example I just used as well as in the truth table from last lecture, I was using Roman letters like x, or y, or P, or Q as variables. But there's nothing sacrosanct about using Roman letters as variables. I could have used anything else so long as it's easy enough to recognize and easy enough to reproduce. Here are some examples. I could have used a dot, or a percentage sign, or a plus sign, or a happy face, or a dollar sign. The problem with all of those is that while they're easy enough to produce, they're not that easy to recognize as variables in propositional logic for the simple reason that they're all used to express other things besides variables and proposition logic. So whereas Roman letters like x, y, P, Q typically aren't used by themselves to express anything at all other than variables. 

So we can use them safely as variables in propositional logic without running the risk that people won't recognize them for what they are. That people will think that they're expressing something else. Notice just as we have notation, Roman letters serving as notation for variables, we also have notation to express truth functions. For instance, in the last lecture I introduced the truth functional connective conjunction. 

And normally, we express conjunction using this ampersand right here. 

And there are other truth functions as well that we're going to learn about in upcoming lectures. One is disjunction which we normally express using an uppercase V. 

And another one is negation which we can express using either one of these two signs that looks a little bit like a minus sign, from arithmetic, but not exactly the same. These are two different ways of expressing negation. Now, again, there's nothing sacrosanct about this notation. 

There have been different notational systems that people have used, there is nothing better about this notational system. We just have to pick one and stick to it for the sake of consistency. So this is the one we are picking, not for any good reason, just because we have to pick one. 

So in upcoming lectures, you're going to learn about disjunction and about negation. And when we talk about those truth functions we're going to use the notation that you see here. 

See you next time. 

### disjunction

Today, we're going to talk about the truth functional connective that we'll call disjunction. And disjunction is a truth functional connective that, in English, is usually expressed by means of the word or, O-R. But there are a couple different ways of using that word, or. Let me give you some examples. Supposed you ask me, who won the game last night? And I say, well, either Manchester won it or Barcelona won it. But there, I'm clearly trying to indicate that, while Manchester may have won it, and Barcelona may have won it, they didn't both win the game, if Manchester was playing Barcelona last night, then they couldn't both have won, right, soccer doesn't work like that. Either one team wins or the other team wins, but they can't both win. 

So if I say, either Manchester won it or Barcelona won it, what I mean is that either one of two possibilities occurred, either Manchester won it or Barcelona won it. But they couldn't both have occurred. 

But sometimes when I use the word, or, I don't mean to convey anything like that, for instance, suppose I say to you, this is breakfast or lunch. 

Now I'm not suggesting when I say this is breakfast or lunch. I'm not suggesting it can't be both It could be breakfast, it could be lunch or it could be both. And when I say this is breakfast or lunch, I mean it could be one, it could be the other it could be both. 

So there in that second usage I'll say, or is inclusive. It includes both of the options and the possibility of they're both being true. In the first usage where I said either Manchester won or Barcelona won, I'll say or is exclusive. In other words, either one is true or the other is true, but they can't both be true. 

So or can be used exclusively to mean that either one of two options is true, but they can't both be true. Or or could be used inclusively. To mean one of two options could be true or they could both be true. 

Now, the truth functional connective disjunction 

is expressed in English by the use of the inclusive or. The or that leaves open the possibility that both of the two options could be true. So what's the truth-table for the truth functional connective disjunction going to look like? Well, we're going to start with two possibilities. Two propositions that are connected by the truth functional connective disjunction. Doesn't matter what the propositions are. Just call them P & Q because it doesn't matter what they are so There's P, there's Q and then, there's the disjunction, a P and Q, which will symbolizes as follows. P disjunction, which looks like a V, Q. 

Now, when is P disjunction Q going to be true? 

Remember, disjunction is expressed by the inclusive or so it's going to be true whenever P is true. And it's also going to be true whenever Q is true and of course since it's expressed by the inclusive or it's going to be true whenever P and Q are both true. 

So the truth table for disjunction is going to look like this, right? The first three lines, the lines that consider the possibility of p and q's, both being true, or p's being true q's being false, or p's being false and q's being true. And all three of those lines the disjunction p or q will be true. 

The only scenario in which P or Q is false is the scenario in which P and Q are both false. In which neither P nor Q is true. 

Now that we've learned the truth table for the truth functional connective, this junction, we can use the truth table to figure out when certain arguments that use this junction Are going to be valid. 

For example, consider this simple argument. Premise one, I'm going to tickle you with my right hand. 

Premise two, I'm going to tickle you with my left hand. Conclusion, I'm going to tickle you with either my right or my left hand. 

Is that argument valid well it obviously is valid but you can use the truth table for disjunction to explain why it's valid. 

Look at the truth table for disjunction again In this argument we have premise one being the proposition, I'm going to tickle you with my right hand. Premise two being the proposition, I'm going to tickle you with my left hand and the conclusion that's the disjunction of those two propositions. 

Well, what can you tell from the truth-table for disjunction? What you can tell is that in a situation in which P is true and Q is true, in which both of two propositions are going to be true. The disjunction of those two propositions is also going to be true. You see, that's what you can read off from the first line of the truth table. In a situation in which each of the two propositions is true, their disjunction has to be true. So in the argument that I just gave you which has as premise one, I'm going to tickle you with my right hand. And as premise two, I'm going to tickle you with my left hand. 

That argument has to be valid, because the conclusion of that argument is simply the dysfunction of the two premises. So there's no possible way for the premises of that argument to be true, while the conclusion is false. If the premises of that argument are true, then the conclusion has to be true. 

We could think of that argument as a kind of disjunction introduction argument, because just as in the case of a conjunction introduction argument where the conclusions introduces a conjunction that wasn't there in the premises, in this argument, the conclusion introduces a disjunction that wasn't there in the premises. Right, there were two premises. I'm going to tickle you with my right hand, and I'm going to tickle you with my left hand. The conclusion introduces the disjunction of those two premises. The conclusion just is the disjunction of those two premises. But notice, even though that disjunction introduction argument is valid, there are even simpler disjunction introduction arguments that are valid. Consider, for instance, the argument that starts with just one premise. Could be anything, call it P. And that draws as a conclusion the disjunction of P with anything else. So let's say, P is the premise I'm going to tickle you with my right hand. And then the conclusion is that it's just the disjunction of that premise, I'm going to tickle you with my right hand, with any other proposition, like say, I'm going to tickle you with my left hand. 

That argument is going to have to be valid, and you can read that off the truth table for disjunction. Because you can see that in any situation in which one of the disjunct of a disjunction is true, the disjunction is going to have to be true. 

So, any disjunction introduction argument that starts with just one premise and that concludes the disjunction of that premise, if anything else, any such argument is going to have to be valid. There's no possible way for the premise of that argument to be true while the conclusion is false. 

So, all this junction and introduction arguments are valid. But what about disjunctional elimination arguments? 
7:53
Well, remember conjuctional elimination arguments are valid, because if you start off with a premise that states the conjunction of two propositions, then the conclusion that is either one of those two conjoint propositions, either one of those propositions, the conclusion is going to have to be true whenever that conjunction is true. You saw that from the truth table for conjunction. But what about with disjunction? 

Does it work that way with disjunction? Well consider an argument that starts from the premise, I'm going to tickle you with either my right or my left hand, and then it draws the conclusion that it is simply one of those two disjoint propositions. Let's say it draws the conclusion, I'm going to tickle you with my right hand. Is that argument valid? 

No it's not. 

Because there's a possible situation in which the premise, I'm going to tickle you with either my right or my left hand is true. While the conclusion, I'm going to tickle you with my right hand is false. 

Namely, the situation in which I'm going to tickle you with my left hand. In that situation, the premise would be true but the conclusion would be false. So that disjunctional elimination argument is not valid. And you can also see that by looking at the truth table for disjunction. If you look at the truth table for disjunction you'll see that there are three possible scenarios in which the premise, I'm going to tickle you with either my right hand or my left hand, is true. The three possible scenarios are the three scenarios in which both of the disjuncts are true, the first disjunct is true and the second one false, or the first disjunct is false and the second one is true. 

Well there are three possible scenarios in which that disjunction is true. When I say I'm not going to tickle you with my right hand, I'm ruling out two of those scenarios, namely the two scenarios in which it's true that I tickle you with my right hand. But that still leaves open a scenario in which it's true, that I'm going to tickle you with either my right hand or my left hand, but for the disjunction elimination argument to be valid, it would have to be the case that in every scenario in which the disjunction, I'm going to tickle you with either my right or my left hand is true. 

Each of those disjunct's is true. 

But that's not the case, and you can see that just by looking at the truth table for disjunction. So, the truth table for disjunction, shows you why it is that disjunction introduction arguments are all valid. 

But symbol disjunction elimination arguments that start with a premise that's just a disjunction of two propositions and end with a conclusion that is simply one of those disjoint propositions by itself, those arguments are not valid. You can see that by the truth table from disjunction. 

## Conjunctions and Disjunctions

### combining conjunctions and disjunctions

In the last couple of lectures, we've learned about the truth functional connective conjunction, and we've learned about the truth functional connective disjunction. Now both of these connectives can be used to take propositions and put them together to create new propositions whose truth depends solely on the truth of the propositions that you used as their ingredients. 

Now, in today's short lecture, I just want to make the point that just as you can combine propositions using conjunction, and you can combine propositions using disjunction, you can also use conjunction and disjunction together to string together a bunch of propositions into a larger proposition. Let me give you an example to illustrate this point. 

Suppose I say, I'm going to tickle you with this hand. And then I say, and I'm either going to tickle you with this hand, or with this hand. Okay? Now here, what I've done is string together three propositions. The proposition I'm going to tickle you with this hand, and the proposition, and I'm either going to tickle you with this hand or with this hand. So there, we've created a new proposition by stringing together three other propositions using conjunction and disjunction. 

Now notice, we can construct a truth table to show how the truth of the larger proposition, I'm going to tickle you with this hand and with either this hand or this hand, how the truth of that larger proposition depends on the truth of the propositions that go into creating it. Okay, so there are three propositions that go into creating it, and they're connected in different ways. So one of the propositions was, I'm going to tickle you with this hand. 

Let's find terms to distinguish the hand, so I don't have to keep waving around all my hands, let's call this hand number one. 

Now the proposition we can say is, I'm going to tickle you with hand number one, and with either hand number two or hand number three. 

Okay, so there are three propositions that go into creating that larger proposition. So the three propositions are these. First, I'm going to tickle you with hand number one. 

Second, I'm going to tickle you with hand number two. And third, I'm going to tickle you with hand number three. 

Now, we can use the truth table to show when precisely it would be true that I'm going to tickle you with hand number one, and with either hand number two or hand number three. 

How does the truth of that whole statement depend on the truth of the three propositions that go into creating it? 

Well, that whole statement, I'm going to tickle you with hand number one, and with either hand number two or hand number three, is a conjunction. It's a conjunction with two conjuncts. The first conjunct is, I'm going to tickle you with hand number one. And the second conjunct is, I'm going to tickle you with either hand number two or hand number three. 

So since it's a conjunction, we know that for it to be true, both of its conjuncts have to be true. So, it has to be true that I'm going to tickle you with hand number one. So that proposition, I'm going to tickle you with hand number one, that proposition has to be true. 

Does it have to be true that I'm going to tickle you with hand number two? 

No. All that has to be true is that I'm either going to tickle you with hand number two or with hand number three. 

So, that disjunction, I'm going to tickle you with hand number two or with hand number three, has to be true. 

But for the disjunction to be true, it doesn't have to be true that I'm going to tickle you with hand number two, after all, there's a scenario where I'm not going to tickle you with hand number two, and yet, it's still true that I'm going to tickle you with either hand number two or hand number three. And for the disjunction, I'm going to tickle you with hand number two or hand number three, to be true, it doesn't have to be true that I'm going to tickle you with hand number three, again, remember, there's a scenario where I'm not going to tickle you with hand number three, but it's still going to be the case that I'm going to tickle you with either hand number two or hand number three. 

But what does have to be true for the disjunction to be true is that at least one of those other two propositions are true. It's at least true that either I'm going to tickle you with hand number two, or I'm going to tickle you with hand number three, or both. 

But at least one of those has to be true. 

So, for the whole proposition, I'm going to tickle you with hand number one, and with hand number two or hand number three, for that whole proposition to be true, it's gotta be true that I'm going to tickle you with hand number one, 

and it's either gotta be true that I'm going to tickle you with hand number two, or it's gotta be true that I'm going to tickle you with hand number three. 

So if we look at the truth table, we can see precisely which lines are going to make the whole proposition true. 

So here's how we can construct a truth table for a complex proposition that combines conjunction and disjunction. 

And notice, by the way, when we're combining conjunction and disjunction, the order in which we combine them matters. We can say that conjunction and disjunction are not associative. What matters to determining the truth table of the proposition that they're used to create, is not just the occurrence of conjunction and disjunction, but what order they're taken in. And the proposition that I considered just a moment ago, I'm going to tickle you with hand number one, and with either hand number two or hand number three, that proposition has a different truth table, 

then the proposition, I'm going to tickle you with hand number one and hand number two, or I'm going to tickle you with hand number three. That second proposition has a very different truth table from the first. As we can see, if we construct the two truth tables and compare them. So, conjunction and disjunction are not associative. The truth table for the proposition that they create depends on the order in which we apply conjunction and disjunction. 

### negation and truth function operators

In the last few lectures we've talked about the truth functional connectives, conjunction and disjunction. We've gone over the truth tables for those connectives and shown how we can use the truth tables to figure out when arguments that use conjunction or disjunction are valid. 

Now, today what I want to do is talk about a propositional device that's not a connective, but that's what I'll call an operative. It doesn't connect two propositions to make a larger proposition, rather what it does is it just operates on a single proposition to make another proposition. You can think of it as converting one proposition to another proposition. 

Now there are lots of propositional operators, for instance, consider the phrase, I believe that. 

That's a propositional operator. You take any proposition, let's say the proposition it's raining today. 

And now you put "I believe that" in front of it and you get a new proposition. I believe that it's raining. 

So, "I believe that" is an example of a propositional operator. 

But I want to talk about a kind of propositional operator that is a truth-functional operator. That's to say the truth or falsity of the proposition that results from applying that operator depends solely upon the truth or falsity of the proposition to which the operator is applied. 

Now, the propositional operator "I believe that" is clearly not truth-functional. 

For instance, suppose it is raining today. Suppose it's true that it's raining today. What does that tell you about whether or not I believe that it's raining today? 

Well, nothing. It could be raining today even though I don't believe that it's raining today. It could be raining today even though I do believe that it's raining today. The truth or falsity of the proposition "I believe that it's raining today" doesn't depend solely upon the truth or falsity of the proposition, it is raining today. It depends on other things as well. It depends in particular on my psychology. 

So the propositional operator "I believe that" is not a truth-functional operator. 

But there is a propositional operator that's truth-functional. In English, the propositional operator that's truth-functional is expressed by the phrase, it is not the case that. 

or sometimes simply by the use of the phrase "not". 

The propositional operator that I have in mind is called negation. Negation is a truth-functional operator that takes any proposition and creates a new proposition whose truth value is the opposite of the truth value of the original proposition. So you take any proposition, if it's true then the negation of that proposition is false. 

Take any proposition, if it's false then the negation of that proposition is true. So, negation is a propositional operator that's an example of a truth-functional operator. The truth of the proposition that results from applying the negation depends solely on the truth of the proposition to which negation is applied. In that respect negation is very different from the propositional operator "II believe that". Now, I said just a moment ago that sometimes the English word not is used to express the truth-functional operator negation, but it's not always used to do that. 

Let me give you an example. Consider the proposition, Walter has stopped beating his dogs. 

Now, that's a proposition and something that could be true or false and it's something that could be the premise or the conclusion of an argument. 

But suppose we put the word not into that proposition. I say, Walter has not stopped beating his dogs. 

Is that the negation of Walter has stopped beating his dogs? 

Well,l let's think about that for a moment. Suppose it's true that Walter has stopped beating his dogs. Well, then pretty clearly it seems like it's false that Walter has not stopped beating his dogs. If he has stopped beating his dogs, then anyone who says that he has not stopped beating his dogs is saying something false. 

But now suppose it's false that Walter has stopped beating his dogs. Does that mean it's true that Walter has not stopped beating his dogs? Well, not necessarily. Think about the different reasons why it could be false, that Walter has stopped beating his dogs. It could be false that Walter has stopped beating his dogs because he is still beating his dogs. Or it could be false that Walter has stopped beating his dogs because in fact he never did beat his dogs. Or it could be false that Walter has stopped beating his dogs because Walter doesn't have any dogs. For that matter, it could be false that Walter has stopped beating his dogs because there is no such person as Walter. Walter doesn't exist, Walter is a mere figment of your imagination. 

So there are all sorts of reasons why it could be false that Walter has stopped beating his dogs. 

And in some of those situations, it would not be true that Walter has not stopped beating his dogs. For instance, if Walter doesn't have any dogs, then even though it's false that Walter has stopped beating his dogs, it's also false that Walter has not stopped beating his dogs. 

So in that example, the word "not" is not being used as negation. 

So suppose I say, Walter has stopped beating his dogs. 

Not. 

Okay, now there, where I say "not", 

all I'm doing is operating on the original proposition, Walter has stopped beating his dogs, and creating a new proposition whose truth value is the opposite of that original proposition. So if I say Walter has stopped beating his dogs but Walter doesn't exist, or Walter never had any dogs, or Walter never did beat his dogs, in any of those situations if I say Walter has stopped beating his dogs, "not", what I just said is true. So sometimes the word not is used to express the truth-functional operator negation, but often it's not used that way. Often when we want to express the truth-functional operator negation, we have to use the more cumbersome English phrase, it is not the case that. 

Now I've told you how negation works, it operates on a particular preposition to create a new proposition who's truth value is the opposite of the truth value of the original proposition. 

But because negation works in such a simple way, it's truth table is going to be very simple. 

So consider any proposition, no matter what, any proposition,call it P. When P is true, the negation of P is going to be false. And when P is false, the negation of P is going to be true. 

That's how negation works. 

### negating and conjunctions and disjunctions

In the last several lectures, we learned about the truth functional connectives, conjunction and disjunction. And we learned about the truth function operator negation. 

Now today I'd like to make a point about how these truth functional devices, these connectives and operators can be combined so as to create larger propositions out of smaller propositions. So consider this conjunction, for lunch I'm going to eat this and this. That's a conjunction. It's a conjunction of the proposition that for lunch I'm going to eat this and the proposition that for lunch I'm going to eat this. 

Now, if we apply negation to that conjunction, what are we saying? We're saying, it's not the case that for lunch I'm going to eat this and this and this. Now that leaves it open that maybe for lunch I'm just going to have one of these two things. 

Maybe just this thing. Whatever that is. 

So if I negate a conjunction 

all I'm doing is saying it's not the case that both of the two conjuncts are true. 

But suppose I create a disjunction out of the two propositions. That for lunch I'm going to eat this. And for lunch I'm going to eat this. I create a disjunction as follows. I say, for lunch I'm either going to eat this, or this. Now if I negate that. If I say it's not the case that for lunch I'm either going to eat this or this. Then I'm saying something that rules out that I'm going to eat either of them for lunch. It's not just that I'm not going to eat both of them. I'm not going to eat either of them. 

Right, my lunch is not going to involve this and it's also not going to involve this. 

So, negating a conjunction 

gives us a different result than negating a disjunction. And that's exactly what we should expect. If we look at the truth-table that results from applying negation to a conjunction and applying negation to a disjunction. 

Remember, when we apply negation to a conjunction we're applying negation to a proposition that's true only when both of its two conjuncts are true and in every other scenario it's false. 

So if we apply negation to that proposition, what do we get? We get a proposition that's going to be true in three out of four possible scenarios. It's going to be true whenever both of the conjuncts are false, and it's going to be true whenever either one of the conjuncts is false. The only situation in which that proposition is going to be false this one both of the conjuncts are true. 

But now contrast that with applying negation to a disjunction. When we apply negation to a disjunction, we're applying negation to a proposition that's true whenever either one of its disjuncts is true. 

So we end up getting a proposition that's false in three out of four possible scenarios. It's false so long as either one of the disjuncts is true. So applying negation to a disjunction is going to give us a different result then applying negation to a conjunction and we can see that by looking at the truth-tables for negation, disjunction, and conjunction. 

### commutativity and associativity 

In the last lecture, we saw how you can combine conjunction and disjunction to build up even larger propositions from propositional units. 

In this lecture, we're going to talk about two properties, commutativity and associativity. 

Properties that we find in conjunction and in disjunction, but that we don't find in other truth functions like the conditional, which we'll study later this week. So, what are commutativity and associativity? Well, let me start by giving a definition of commutativity. A function of two things is commutative. It has commutativity when it delivers the same result no matter what order it operates on those things. Now, that is a very abstract characterization and that's a characterization that can apply to functions in all different domains. For instance, in arithmetic, there are functions like addition and addition is an example of the commutative function. Addition is a function that can operate on two inputs, you can add two numbers together. And the result that you get when you add two numbers together doesn't depend on the order in which you add the numbers. For example, 2+3 is the same as 3+2. And in general, for any two numbers x and y. X+y is the same as y+x. So, addition is commutative. Addition is an example of a function that has commutativity. Another example of an arithmetical function that's commutative is multiplication. For example, 4 multiplied by 8 is the same as 8 multiplied by 4. More generally, for any two numbers x and y, x multiplied by y is the same as y multiplied by x. So, multiplication is a commutative function. It's a function that has commutativity, but notice not all arithmetical functions are commutative. For instance, subtraction is not commutative. 7-3 is not the same as 3-7. And more generally, for most numbers x and y, x-y is not the same and y-x. That's not true for every assignment of numbers to x and y, but it's true for most. Generally, we can't expect x-y to be equal to y-x. So subtraction is not a commutative function, neither is division. So addition and multiplication are commutative, but subtraction and division are not commutative. 

Now, the same points can be made about truth-functional connectives in propositional logic. For instance, the truth-functional connective conjunction is commutative. 

Consider the proposition, I'm standing and waving. That's the conjunction of two propositions, I'm standing and I'm waving. I'm standing and waving is the conjunction of those two propositions. Well, that's the same proposition as I'm waving and standing. They're just two different ways of saying the same thing. Maybe one is a more elegant way of saying it than the other, but they're saying the same thing. What they're saying is the same. In general, the conjunction of any two propositions, p and q is exactly the same as the conjunction of the propositions q and p. Conjunction operates on two propositions and it doesn't matter what order you put the propositions in. P conjunction q is the same proposition, as q conjunction p. So, conjunction is a commutative truth function. The same is true of disjunction. Disjunction is also a commutative truth function. So consider the proposition, I'm standing or waving. That's a disjunction, but it's the same proposition as I'm waving or standing. 

In general, for any two proposition p, q, the disjunction p or q is the same proposition as the disjunction q or p. 

So, disjunction is a commutative truth function like conjunction. But later on this week, we'll learn about another truth function that we'll call the conditional. Sometimes it's called the material conditional, but the conditional is not a commutative truth function. With the conditional, the order in which it operates on propositions determines the result that you get. 

We'll see that later this week when we study the conditional. So, that's commutativity. Now, what about associativity? Well, what's associativity? Here's a definition. A function of three or more things is associative when it delivers the same result no matter what order it operates on those things. 

So, let's look at some examples of associative functions and of functions that are not associative. First, we'll begin with arithmetic. 

So just as addition is a commutative function, it's also an associative function. To illustrate, consider a case where addition applies to three things instead of just two. Consider adding 2 to 3 plus 6. Well, the sum of 2 and 3 plus 6, notice that's going to be the same as the sum of 2 plus 3 and 6. Both of them are going to add up to 11. And more generally, for any three numbers x, y and z. The sum of x and y+z is going to be equal to the sum of x+y and z. It doesn't matter whether we group the y and z together and then add that to the x or whether we group the x, and y together and add that to the z. Either way, we get the same result. So, addition is an associative function. It's an example of an arithmetical function that has associativity. The same is true for multiplication. Notice if we multiply 2 by the product of 3 and 6, we get the same number as we get if we multiply the product of 2 and 3 by 6. Either way, we get 36. So in general, for any three numbers x, y and z, the product of x and y times z is the same as the product of x times y and z. So, that explains why multiplication is associative. It's an example of arithmetical function that has associativity, but not arithmetical are associative. In particular, subtraction is not associative. Take any three numbers, x, y, and z. Now, start by subtracting z from y and then subtract the result of that from x. You're going to get a different number in general than if you start by subtracting y from x and then subtract z from that number. So, x-(y-z) is in general, not the same as (x-y)-z. 

So, subtraction is not associative and neither for that matter is division. So addition and multiplication are associative, just as they're commutative. Subtraction and division are not associative, just as they're not commutative. Analogously with truth functions, we can see that conjunction is associative. For example, consider the proposition I'm standing and he's sitting and waving. Well, that's the same as the proposition I'm standing and he's sitting and he's also waving. In general, for any three propositions p, q and r. The conjunction of p with q and r is going to be the same proposition, as the conjunction p and q with r. Now, just as conjunction is associative so too is disjunction. We can see an example. For instance, if I say, I'm standing or he's sitting or waving. 

Well, that's the same proposition as I'm standing or he's sitting or he's waving. In general, for any three propositions, p, q and r. The disjunction of p with q or r is going to be the same proposition, as the disjunction of p or q with r. 

So disjunction, like conjunction is associative. But again, not all truth functions are associative. Later this week, we're going to learn about a truth function called the conditional that is not associative. When the conditional operates on three or more inputs, it matters very much the order in which it operates on those inputs. Because depending on the order, you end up with a different propositional result. 

So, that's enough about commutativity and associativity. See you next time. 


## Conditionals

### the conditional

Today’s lecture is about conditionals. Conditionals are a kind of truth functional connective that we haven’t discussed yet. But today we're going to introduce this new kind of truth functional connective, discuss the truth table for it, and say why it’s important. It's especially important in understanding the rules by which to assess the validity of deductive arguments. 

Now in order to introduce this new truth functional connective, the conditional, I want to start by telling you a story. 

Imagine that Walter has been breaking into my office and stealing my stuff. 

So, each day I come into my office, and I find that more and more of my stuff is gone. One day, he steals my electronics, and another day, he steals my coffee cup, and then another day, he steals my clothing. And then yet another day, he steals my glasses. And before long, there's very little stuff in my office. Now as this happens, I start to get suspicious, and I decide to have Walter followed by a private investigator, just to figure out exactly whether or not Walter is stealing my stuff. So I have the private investigator follow Walter everywhere he goes, right? He follows him to his house at night. Then he follows him to the bar early in the morning. He follows him to the golf course later in the morning. Then he follows him to the water polo tournament in the afternoon, follows him everywhere he goes. Now, suppose you asked me, is the private investigator having lunch at that Cuban restaurant, New Havana? 

Now, I might say to you, well, if Walter is having lunch there, then the private investigator is having lunch there. 

Okay, now notice what I just said. I said if Walter is having lunch there, then the private investigator is having lunch there. 

That phrase, if, then, can be used to connect two propositions, the proposition, Walter is having lunch at New Havana, with the proposition, the private investigator is having lunch in New Havana. So, that phrase if, then works as a propositional connective. It connects two propositions to make a larger proposition. 

But does it work as a truth functional connective? 

Now, I'd like to argue that it does. 

Okay, so how are we going to argue that if, then is not just a propositional connective, but it's also a truth functional connective? 

Well, I'd like to begin by considering the following truth functional construction. Consider the negation of the conjunction of P and the negation of Q. All right, I've written that out here, the negation of the conjunction of P and the negation of Q. 

Now suppose I say, that whole proposition is true. 

Well, if I say that whole proposition is true, then what I'm saying is just that the negation of that proposition, in other words, just the conjunction of P and the negation of Q, that that proposition is false. 

But what does it mean when I say that the conjunction of P and the negation of Q is false? Well, what I'm saying there is that if P is true, 

then, the negation of Q has to be false, right? 

Because if the conjunction of P and the negation of Q is false, then you can't have both of those conjuncts being true. At least one of them has to be false. So if P is true, then the other conjunct, the negation of Q has to be false. 

So you're saying there that if P is true, then the negation of Q is false. 

But remember, for the negation of Q to be false is just the same thing as for Q to be true because the negation of Q has just the opposite truth value of whatever Q has. So to say if P is true, then the negation of Q is false is just the same as to say if P is true, then Q is true. But that's exactly what you're doing whenever you use if, then as a propositional connective. You're saying, if one proposition is true, like let's say, Walter is eating lunch at New Havana, then another proposition is true. Like let's say, the private investigator is eating lunch at New Havana. If P, then Q, that proposition follows from the negation of the conjunction P and the negation of Q. But while if P, then Q follows from the negation of that conjunction, is it equivalent to it? 

Now I just argued that if P, then Q 

follows from the negation of the conjunction P and the negation of Q. But now what I'd like to do is argue that latter proposition, the negation of the conjunction of P and the negation of Q, that that proposition follows from if P, then Q. 

Consider for a moment what you're saying when you say if P, then Q. You're saying if P is true, then Q has gotta be true. 

So you're ruling out a certain option. You're ruling out the possibility that P is true while Q is false. When you say, if P, then Q, you're ruling out the possibility that P is true and Q is false. 

In other words, you were ruling out the possibility that P is true, and the negation of Q is true. 

In other words, you're saying P and the negation of Q, that conjunction right there has gotta be false. 

In other words, you're saying that the negation of the conjunction P and the negation of Q is true. 

So you see the negation of the conjunction P and the negation of Q follows from if P, then Q. And if P, then Q follows from the negation of the conjunction of P and the negation of Q. 

So what that tells us is that the proposition if P, then Q is going to be true in precisely the same situations as the proposition which is the negation of the conjunction P in the negation of Q. 

So if they're true in all the same situations, that just means that they're going to have the same truth table. In other words, if P, then Q is going to have a truth table. And it's going to have precisely the same truth table as the negation of the conjunction of P and the negation of Q. 

That's what we learn by noticing that if P, then Q follows from the negation of the conjunction of P and the negation of Q and that the negation of the conjunction of P and the negation of Q follows from if P, then Q, is that they have the same truth table. 

And since if P, then Q has a truth table, that proves that it's a truth functional connective. It's a propositional connective that create propositions whose truth value depends solely on the truth values of the propositions that go into it. So it's a truth functional connective. 

Now that we've talked about the conditional, and we've explained how the truth table for the conditional works, let's talk about some rules governing our use of the conditional. And then when we say something about why the conditional is an especially important truth functional connective. 

So first I want to talk about a rule called modus ponens. 

Modus ponens says from the premises P, whatever P is, and if P, then Q, whatever exactly P and Q are, 

infer the conclusion Q, that's what modus ponens says. Now notice, we can use the truth table for the conditional to show that modus ponens is a good rule of inference. Look here. So, suppose you know that P is true, and if P, then Q is true. So, what does that tell you? 

Well, since P is true, we've gotta be in one of these first two scenarios, one of the two top rows of the truth table. 

And since the conditional if P, then Q is true, we've gotta be in either the first, third, or fourth row of that truth table. 

But then, what does that tell us? Well, if we've gotta be in one of the two top rows and we've gotta be in either the first, third, or fourth row, then the only possible choice is that we've gotta be in the top row. In other words, we've gotta be in a situation in which P is true, if P, then Q is true, and Q is true. 

Another way of putting that is in any situation in which P is true and if P, then Q is true, Q has gotta be true. And so modus ponens is a good rule of inference. If we follow modus ponens, we'll never give an invalid argument. All right, no modus ponens argument can be invalid. Because whenever P is true and if P, then Q is true, Q has gotta be true. 

Okay, so modus ponens is a good rule of inference. 

There's another rule called modus tollens, which says the following. From the premises not Q, the negation of Q and the premise if P, then Q, infer the conclusion, not P, or the negation of P. 

Now, is that a good rule? 

Well once again, we can use the truth table to see that it is. 

So here is what the two premises tell us. They tell us if P, then Q is true, so we've gotta be in the first, third, or fourth rows of that truth table. And they also tell us that the negation of Q is true. In other words, that Q itself is false, right, because when the negation of Q is true, then Q is false. 

So that tells us we've gotta be in either the second or the fourth row of that truth table. Okay, so here's what the premises tell us. We're either in the second or fourth row of the truth table, and we're in either the first, third, or fourth row of the truth table. Well, the only option left is that we are in the fourth row of the truth table. In other words, if we're in a situation in which if P, then Q is true, and not Q is true, in other words, Q is false, then the only possible situation we could be in is a situation in which P is false. But of course, that's a situation in which not Q is true. 

So if we follow modus tollens and make arguments that follow that rule, all of our arguments will be valid. Any argument that has as its premises, two premises of the form if P, then Q and the negation of Q, and has as its conclusion the negation of P, any argument of that form will have to be valid. And that's what we can see, using the truth table for the condition. 

So modus ponens and modus tollens are two rules governing our use of the conditional. And we can see, using the truth table, that they're both valid rules of argument, just like conjunction elimination or disjunction introduction. Okay, now I've said something about what the conditional means, what its truth table is, and what some good rules for its usage are. 

Why is the conditional an important truth functional connective? It's pretty clear why disjunction and conjunction are important truth functional connectives. They're very intuitive, they seem to correspond to notions that we operate with in everyday life, but what about the conditional? 

Here's what makes the conditional especially important for propositional logic. 

Consider any argument whatsoever that has some premises and a conclusion. Let's call the premises of that argument P and the conclusion C. 

Now, whatever that argument is, if that argument from premises P to conclusion C is valid, then the conditional, if P, then C, has gotta be true. And here's why, if the argument from P to C is valid, what that tells us is that there's no possible way for P to be true while C is false. 

But what does it mean for the conditional if P, then C to be true? All it means is that if P is true, then C has gotta be true. 

It's not the case that P is true, and C is false. So, whenever the argument from P to C is valid, the conditional if P, then C is going to be true. And so we can use the conditional to express in the form of a single proposition the validity of an argument from premises P to conclusion C, whatever that argument is about. The conditional can be used to express the validity of that argument. And that's what makes the conditional especially useful in propositional logic.
