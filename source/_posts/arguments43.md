# Refutation: Its Varieties and PItfalls

CONTENT: This week we will teach you various strategies for refuting a fallacious argument. To refute an argument is to show that the argument is unsuccessful. Even if you are able to identify a fallacious argument as a fallacy, you might still not be able to prove to others that it is a fallacy. In this week, you will learn a variety of techniques for proving to others that the argument is a fallacy. LEARNING OUTCOMES: By the end of this week you will be able to: refute fallacious arguments OPTIONAL READING: If you want more examples or more detailed discussions of these topics, we recommend Understanding Arguments, Ninth Edition, Chapter 17.

## Refutation

### Refutation

Over the last couple of weeks, we've been talking about fallacies in order to help you all figure out ways in which you can criticize an argument. Sometimes, an argument might seem valid or strong. But if you recognize that it's actually a fallacy, that'll help you to see what's wrong with the argument and not to be moved by it. 

But there are other ways of criticizing arguments besides recognizing them as fallacies. Or, in any case, recognizing them as the one, one of the kinds of fallacies that we've been discussing so far over the past couple of weeks. And this week we're going to broaden our scope a little bit and talk about other ways of criticizing arguments. This week we're going to talk about refutation, its varieties and pitfalls. So, what's refutation? What are the varieties of refutation? What are the pitfalls of refutation? Let's address those questions in order. So, first, what is refutation? 

Refutation, or to refute an argument, is to show that the argument is unsuccessful in some way or other. That's what you're doing when you refute an argument. You're showing that the argument is unsuccessful in some way or other. Now, an argument might be unsuccessful because we're not entitled to accept its premises, right? Maybe its premises are false or maybe whether they're true or false, we just have no reason to accept them. 

Or an argument may be unsuccessful because whether or not its premise are true or known by us to be true, the premises don't support the conclusion of the argument. 

So, the conclusion isn't adequately supported by the premises. It doesn't follow from the premises. It's not something that the premises give us very powerful reason to believe. So, we can refute an argument by showing that it's unsuccessful in any of those ways. 

Okay. So, because refuting an argument is just to show that it's unsuccessful in any of those ways, there are going to be different ways to refute an argument corresponding to the different ways. In which arguments can be unsuccessful. So, for instance, 

if we're going to show that the premises of an argument don't support its conclusion, then we can do that by means of something that we'll call refutation by parallel reasoning. 

Right? One way of doing that, of course, is to point out that the argument is a fallacy. Right? It might appear valid or strong but, in fact, it's not. But another way of doing that, independently of pointing out that it's a fallacy, is to refute the argument by parallel reasoning. And in the next lecture, we'll talk about what refutation by parallel reasoning is. 

Another way that we might refute an argument is by showing that its premises are false or in any case whether they're false or not, we're not entitled to accept them. And we can do that, we can show that we're not entitled to accept the premises by using things that we'll call counter examples. Or a method that we'll call, reductio ad absurdum. 

Okay. So those are the varieties of refutation. We can refute an argument by means of parallel reasoning. We can refute an argument by means of counterexamples. Or we can refute an argument by reductio ad absurdum. And we'll talk about those different varieties of refutation this week. 

Now, often refutations are successful and help us to see why an argument that someone else is giving or maybe an argument that we ourselves gave is unsuccessful. But sometimes, refutations don't work. In particular, there are a couple of different kinds of error to which refutations are especially liable. 

One of those kinds of error is what's called attacking a straw man, or refuting a straw man. Sometimes, when you try to refute a particular argument, you end up attacking something that isn't quite the same as that argument. Something that might seem very similar to that argument, you might mistake it for being the same as that argument. But its not quite the same and the difference is significant. That's called attacking a straw man. Your refutation of an argument also might be unsuccessful because it depends upon a false dichotomy. You assume that a particular dichotomy is true. Either things have to be one way or have to be other way and you make that assumption in attempting to refute an argument. But your refutation is unsuccessful because the assumption that you've made, the assumption that things have to be either one way or another way, is a false assumption. That's called a false dichotomy. Okay, so those are some dangers to which refutation is subject, and we'll also be talking about those this week. 

Alright, so now that we've said what refutation is, what its varieties are and what its dangers are, let's start talking about particular kinds of refutation. Next time, we're going to talk about refutation by parallel reasoning. See you next time. 

在过去的几周里 我们一直在讨论谬论的有关内容 以便你可以对一个论证进行评价 有时 一个论证可能看起来有效或者说是有力的 但是 如果你发现他其实是个谬论 这会让你搞清楚这个论证的错误所在 不要被它所糊弄 

除此之外 还有其他的方法来评断一个论证 除了将它们归为谬误之外 总之 将它们归为我们过去几周所讨论的 所讨论的谬误之一 在这个周 我们要将我们讨论的范围 扩大一些 讨论另外几种评价论断的方法 本周 我们将讨论反驳 它的种类以及陷阱 那什么是反驳呢？ 反驳的种类又有哪些 关于反驳的陷阱又是什么 让我们一个一个的来解决这些问题 首先 什么是反驳 

反驳 或者说驳斥一个论点 就是 说明一个论点在某个或某些方面是失败的 这就是你在反驳一个论点的时候所做的 你在说明一个论点在某个或某些方面是失败的 一个论证无效 我们不接受它所设置的前提 对不对 有可能它的前提本身为假 或者 无论它们是真是假 但我们没有理由来接受这个前提假设 

或者 一个论证失败的原因 不在于前提是否为真或我们认为其为真 或者说我们知不是道它是真是假 而是这些前提不能有力的支撑论证的结论 

所以 这个结论是不能被前提所充分支持的 它并不能由前提所导出 它并不是可以让我们充分相信的前提假设 所以 我们可以通过说明一个论点在一些地方是失败的来 反驳这个论点 

好 所以 因为反驳一个论点就是 说明它在某些方面是不成立的 这有几种不同的方式来反驳一个论点 来反驳一个论点 通过这种方法来证明论点是不成立的 

例如 如果我们要证明一个论证的前提 不能支持它的结论 那么我们可以通过 平行推理的方式来反驳 

对吧? 其中一种做法 就是指出这个论证是一个谬论 对吧? 也许它看起来是有效或者有力的 但实际上并不是 另外一种做法 与指出它是谬论不同  是通过平行推理的方法来反驳一个论证 下一讲 我们将讨论 基于平行推理的反驳 

另一种可以用来反驳论证的方式 就是证明前提为假 或者无论前提真假如何 我们都没有接受的理由 我们可以通过举反例的方式 来说明这些前提 不可接受 或者另一种方法 也就是我们所说的归谬法 

这些就是反驳的几种类型 我们可以通过平行推理来反驳一个论证 我们也可以通过举反例 或者我们可以通过归谬法 我们将要在本周 讨论这几种不同的反驳 

反驳通常都是有效的 可以帮我们来分辨 我们自己所作出的某些论证 是无效的 不过 在有些情况下 反驳法是无效的 尤其 有几种类型的错误 的错误 

其中一种错误被称为 攻击稻草人 或者说反驳稻草人 有些时候 当你试图反驳一个观点的时候 结果你却攻击了一个其实跟这个论点不太一致的东西 有些事情可能看起来和这个论点是一回事 所以你错将其与论证等同 但是他们其实并不相同 不同之处可能还很明显 这就是我们所说的攻击稻草人 你对于论点的反驳可能是无效的 因为你的反驳建立在一个错误的二分法基础之上 你建设一个二分法是正确的 也就是说一件事不是这样就肯定是那样 你通过做出这个假设来试图反驳一个论点 但是你的反驳是失败的 因为你所做的假设 即事情不是这样就是那样 是一个错误的假设 这就是所谓的错误的二分法 这些就是反驳的几种可能的失误所在 我们在这周就要讨论一下这几种问题 

所以 我们已经解释了什么叫做反驳 以及它的种类 和它可能失败的原因 接下来让我们讨论几种典型的反驳类型 下一次我们将要 期待与你的下次见面 

### Refutation by Parallel Reasoning

Today we're going to talk about refutation by parallel reasoning. 

Okay, so what is refutation by parallel reasoning? Let me start by giving a definition and then I'll give some examples. 

So first, to refute an argument by parallel reasoning is to show that an argument's form is not valid or strong, the form of the argument is bad. 

Now, one way to show that, a way that we've described over past couple of weeks is to show that the argument commits one of the fallacies that we have described. For an instance that it commits some kind of slippery soap fallacy or it's a fallacious dismisser or, a fallacious amplifier or commits a fallacy of [UNKNOWN]. That's one way to show that an argument is a fallacy that it's form is not valid or strong. That it's premises whether true or not don't support it's conclusion. But sometimes an argument is a fallacy even though it doesn't fit into any of the categories of fallacy that we have described up until now. 

But you can still show it's a fallacy. And the way you show it's a fallacy then is to refute it by parallel reasoning. And the way you do that is by finding another argument that has exactly the same form as the first argument. 

Exactly the same form, but the other argument is clearly a fallacy. So if the second argument is clearly a fallacy and it has the same form as the first argument, then the first argument must also be clearly a fallacy. Since whether an argument is a fallacy or not doesn't depend on the truth of its premises or the truth of its conclusion. Whether an argument is a fallacy or not just depends on its form. 

On the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. 

So if you can find an argument with exactly the same form that's clearly a fallacy, that shows that the first argument is a fallacy that's refutation by parallel reasoning. Now let me give you some examples. 

So consider this argument premise. If I had a bigger salary, I could buy a bigger house. 

Conclusion therefore if everyone had a higher salary, everyone could buy a bigger house. 

Okay, now I've heard reasoning that resembles this kind of reasoning in the past. People think, well, if we can raise one person's wages and make them material, materially better off, then if we could raise everyone's wages, we could make everyone materially better off. 

Okay, but tempting as this kind of reasoning may be, it's fallacious. And in order to show that it's fallacious, let me it refute by parallel reasoning. Let me find another argument that has exactly the same form but that's obviously fallacy. 

So, consider this example. This is a parallel argument. 

If one person stands up at a ball game then she'll get a better view. I'd imagine that she's sitting in an audience of people. All of whom are seated. And so there are all these people seated and watching the ball game and maybe the people sitting in front of her are blocking her view of the events in the stadium. So she decides to stand up so she can see over the heads of the people seated in front of her. So if she stands up she'll get a better view. Conclusion, if everyone stands up at a ball game then everyone will get a better view. 

Okay, well, that conclusion is not just obviously false but it's clearly not supported by the true premise. In fact, this argument is a very clear example of an invalid argument, because the premise is very plausibly true. At just about any ball game, when you have one person sitting down, if they stand up, they're, they individually are going to get a better view, but the conclusion is certainly false. If everyone stands up, then that does not mean that everyone will get a better view. In fact, if everyone stands up then there going to be some people who end up getting a worse view. 

So, this is clearly an invalid argument but if this argument is invalid then this argument must also be invalid because they have the same form. 

And that shows that this first argument about salaries has got to be invalid. It's got to be invalid because it has exactly the same form as the second argument about standing up at a ball game. It has exactly the same form and the second argument is obviously a fallacy because in most scenarios, the premise would be true when the conclusion would be false. So, if the second argument is invalid, the first argument must be as well. 

Okay, that's an example of refutation by parallel reasoning. Now, let's consider another example. So, we get the idea. So, consider this argument. Premise one. Most people who start businesses, start their own businesses, ignore statistics of failure. Right? Because the statistics of failure for start-up businesses are pretty bleak. 

vast majority of start-up businesses fail. They lose money, they go out of business they go into bankruptcy. 

So, most people who start businesses have to ignore all that, have to believe somehow, despite all this statistics of failure that they are going to succeed. 

Premise two, most people who ignore statistics of failure are stupid. Conclusion, therefore, most people who start businesses are stupid. 

Okay now let me say immediatley that I think this this argument is a fallacy and further more that its conclusion is false. 

But, how can we see that this argument is a fallacy. For most people who start businesses ignore statistics of failure, and most people who ignore statistics of failure are stupid. How can we see that it's fallacious to infer most people who start businesses are stupid. 

Well to see how this argument is a fallacy compared to this other argument that has exactly the same form of reasoning. So, here's a parallel argument, most of my friends are organisms. 

Alright, I mean it's possible that a few of my friends are robots but I think that's unlikely. I think, at the very least most of my friends are organisms. If one or two of them are automata who are cleverly disguised to look and act like human beings, so be it. Still, most of my friends I'm confident are organisms. 

Now most organisms are microscopic 

Of course we don't always keep that in mind because most of the organisms that we interact with on a day to day basis are not microscopic. Human beings, dogs, cats, trees right these organisms are not microscopic but in fact most of the organisms that exist are microscopic. 

So someone might infer well if most of my friends are organisms and most organisms are microscopic then doesn't it follow that most of my friends are microscopic. 

Well no obviously not. In fact none of my friends are microscopic all of my friends are creatures that I can see. 

without the use of a microscope. 

So this argument right here is obviously a fallacy. I mean both of the premises are true and the conclusion is certainly false. So, this argument is obviously a fallacy. It's an invalid argument but since this argument is invalid and it has exactly the same form as this earlier argument about ignoring statistics of failure, it follows that the earlier argument must be invalid. Right, this earlier arguments from the premises, most people who start businesses ignore statistics of failure and most people who ignore statistics of failure are stupid. It does not follow that most people who start businesses are stupid. 

That doesn't follow at all. This is a fallacy. It's an invalid argument. 

Just showed that by means of parallel reasoning. By finding a parallel argument that has exactly the same form but is clearly a fallacy. So since this parallel argument is clearly a fallacy, this earlier argument about ignoring statistics of failure must also be a fallacy. Okay, now refutation by parallel reasoning doesn't always work. Sometimes, we get results that are unclear or don't show what we were trying to show. For instance, let me give you an example of that. 

So consider the following argument. 

If guns are outlawed only outlaws will have guns. That's premise one. Premise two, it would be bad if only outlaws had guns. 

Conclusion, therefore guns should not be outlawed. 

Okay so that's an argument that'll be familiar to some Americans. that's an argument. Is it a fallacy or not? Well suppose we try to refute it by parallel reasoning as follows. 

If gum is outlawed, only outlaws will have gum. 

It would be bad if only outlaws had gum, therefore, gum should not be outlawed. 

Now notice, this parallel argument has exactly the same form as this earlier argument about guns. The two arguments have the same form. 

So if one of them is a fallacy then the other one is a fallacy. But is this argument a fallacy. 

That's not clear. 

Its not at all clear that its a fallacy. So. 

This attempt to refute our earlier argument by parallel reasoning doesn't succeed. It doesn't succeed because the parallel argument is not clearly a fallacy. 

So we can't tell by looking at the parallel argument whether the earlier argument about guns was a fallacy. 

So this is a case of refutation by parallel reasoning that doesn't succeed. 

So what's crucial in refutation by parallel reasoning is this. First of all, you have to make sure that the parallel argument that you're using to refute the original argument, that the parallel argument has exactly the same form as the original argument. And in all three of our examples that we've looked at that is true, the parallel argument does have the same form as the original argument. But the second thing you need to make sure of is that the parallel argument is clearly a fallacy. Right, if you're trying to show that the original argument is a fallacy, and you're trying to show it by means of parallel reasoning, then the parallel argument that you pick has to clearly be a fallacy. because otherwise, you haven't shown that the original argument is a fallacy. 

Okay, and this third example doesn't meet that second criterion. The parallel argument is not clearly a fallacy. 

Okay. 

So, that's refutation by parallel reasoning. Next time, we'll consider another way of refuting an argument. See you next time. 

今天我们将要探讨的是通过平行推理反驳 

好的 那么什么是通过平行推理反驳呢? 让我先给出定义再举几个例子 

首先 通过平行推理反驳一个论证就是证明 一个论证的形式是无效的或不强 也就是证明论证的形式不好 

现在 证明它的一种方法 这种方法我们在过去的几周中讨论过 就是证明这个论证 犯了我们讨论过的其中一种谬误 例如它犯了某种形式的(不知道怎么翻)谬论 或者它是一个谬误解散(不知道怎么翻)  或者谬误放大器 又或者犯了某种未知的谬误 [嘟囔] 说明某个论证是谬论的一种方式是 证明它的形式是无效或者不强的 也就是不管它的前提是否为真 都无法支持它的结论 但是有时候一个论证也可能为谬论 即使它不属于 我们至今为止讨论过的任何一种类型的谬论 

但是仍然可以证明它为谬误 证明它是谬论方式就是通过平行推理来反驳它 并且 我们是通过找到另一个 与第一个论证具有严格相同的形式的论证来证明它 

严格相同的形式 但是另一个论证显然是个谬论 所以如果第二个论证显然是个谬论 而且它与第一个论证有相同的形式 那么第一个论证显然也是个谬论 因为一个论证是否为谬误不取决于 前提或者结论的真假 一个论证是否为谬论取决于它的形式 

取决于前提与结论之间的关系 

所以 如果你能找到一个具有完全相同的形式而且显然是一个谬论的论证 即可证明第一个论证是个谬论 这就是用平行推理反驳论证 下面来看几个例子 

考虑这个论证 前提:  如果我有更高的工资 我可以买更大的房子 

结论: 因此如果每人都有更高的工资 每个人都可以买更大的房子 

好的 我曾听过 类似于这个推理的一个推理 有人认为 如果提高一个人的工资 使他们享受更好的物质条件 那么如果 提高每个人的工资 就能使每个人都享受到更好的物质条件 

好吧 这种类型的论证可能很诱人 但是它是个谬论 为了证明它是谬论 我们利用平行推理来证明 让我找另一个 具有完全相同的形式 但是显然是谬论的论证 

所以考虑这个例子 这是一个平行论证 

如果一个人 在看球的时候站起来 那么她能获得更好的视野 假设她是坐在一群观众中间 所有人都是坐着的 所有人都是坐着看球的 可能 体育馆中坐在她前面的人 挡住了她看球的视线 所以她决定站起来 那么她能越过 坐在她前面的那些人的脑袋 看得更清楚 所以 如果她站起来 她能获得更好的视野 结论: 如果每个人看球赛的时候都站起来 那么每个人都能获得更好的视野 

好吧 结论似乎并不是明显错误的 但是它明显并不被真前提所支持 事实上 这个论证是无效论证的一个例子 因为前提似乎为真 在几乎任何一场球赛上 某个本来坐着的人 如果让他站起来 那么他自己将获得一个更好的视野 但是结论明显是错误的 如果每个人都站起来 并不意味着每个人都会获得更好的视野 事实上 如果每个人都站起来  那么结果会是有些人获得了更差的视野 

所以明显这是一个无效的论证 如果这个论证是无效的 那么刚刚那个论证也是无效的 因为它们具有相同的形式 

这说明第一个关于薪水的论证一定是无效的 它是无效的是因为它同第二个 关于在球场上站起来的论证具有严格相同的形式  它有相同的形式 而且第二个论证明显是个谬论  因为在大多数情况下 前提为真而结论为假 所以如果第二个论证是无效的 那么第一个论证也是无效的 

好吧 这就是通过平行推理反驳的一个例子 现在 让我们考虑另一个例子 我们已经理解了这个方法 现在考虑这个论证 前提之一 大部分创业的人 自己创业的人 都忽略了统计得到的失败率 对吧? 因为创业的失败率相当的残酷 

大部分创业都是以失败告终 他们损失钱财 停业 破产 

所以 大部分开始创业的人必须忽略这个 去相信即使有这些失败率的存在 他们也会成功 

前提二: 大部分忽略失败率的人都是愚蠢的 结论: 因此 大部分创业的人都是愚蠢的 

好吧 很明显我认为 这个论证是个谬论而且它的结论是错误的 

但是 我们如何得出这个论证是谬论呢 大部分开始创业的人都忽略失败率  而大部分忽略失败率的人都是愚蠢的 那么为什么推出 大部分开始创业的人都是晕蠢的这个结论就是谬论了呢? 

好吧 为了说明为什么这个论证是谬论 需要对比 与这个论证具有完全相同的推理形式的论证 这有一个平行论证 我的大部分朋友都是生物体 

好吧 我的意思是可能 我的一些朋友是机器人 但是我认为那不大可能 我认为至少我的大部分朋友都是生物体 如果他们中的一两个是机器人 而且聪明地伪装成人类 就随便它们吧 但是我还是很有信心地认为我大部分的朋友都是生物体 

大部分生物体都是微生物 

当然我们可能不知道这一点  因为我们日常生活中接触到的大部分生物体都不是微生物 人类 狗 猫 树这些生物体 都不是微生物 但是事实上大部分生物体都是微生物 

所以 有人可能推断 如果我大部分的朋友都是生物体 而且 大部分生物体都是微生物 那么不是能够推断出 我大部分的朋友都是微生物吗? 

显然这是不对的 事实上 没有一个朋友是微生物 我所有朋友都是我能看见的生物 

不需要显微镜也能看见的生物 

所以这个论证显然是个谬论 我的意思是两个前提都为真而结论显然为假 所以 这个论证显然是谬论 它是一个无效的论证 但是因为这个论证是无效的 而且它同前一个忽略失败率的论证 具有完全相同的形式 所以前一个论证也是无效的 对的 前一个论证 根据前提 大部分开始创业的人都忽略创业的失败率 和大部分忽略失败率的人都很愚蠢 无法得出大部分开始创业的人都很愚蠢的结论 

根本不能推出这个结论 这是个谬论 它是个无效论证 

通过平行推理的方法证明了这一点 通过找到一个具有完全相同的形式 但是显然是谬论的平行论证 因为这个平行论证显然是谬论 那么前面那个关于忽略失败率的论证也一定是 谬论 好吧 通过平行推理反驳论证 并不一定总是有用 有时候 我们得到的是不清楚的结果 或者无法证明我们想要证明的结果 例如 我可以举这个例子 

思考下面的论证 

如果持枪是违法的 只有歹徒有枪 这是前提一 前提二 只有歹徒有枪很不好 

结论: 因此持枪应该合法 

好吧 这个论证 对很多美国人来说很熟悉 这是个论证 它是否是谬论呢? 好吧 假设我们通过如下的平行推理来反驳它 

如果持枪是违法的 只有歹徒有枪 

只有歹徒有枪是件很不好的事 因此 持枪应该合法 

注意到 这个平行论证具有 与刚刚那个关于枪支的论证完全相同的形式 这两个论证具有相同的形式 

所以如果其中一个是谬论 那么另一个也是谬论 但是这个论证是谬论吗? 

这是不明确的 

它是否是谬论并不显然 

所以 尝试通过平行推理 反驳刚才那个论证并不成功 它不成功是因为这个平行论证不一定是谬论 

所以我们无法根据这个平行论证判断 刚刚那个关于枪支的论证是否是谬论 

所以这是通过平行推理反驳失败的一个例子 

那么什么是通过平行推理反驳的关键点呢? 首先 你要保证你用来反驳原论证的的平行论证 具有同原论证 完全相同的形式 这一点在我们刚刚举的三个例子中都是成立的 平行论证确实同原论证有完全相同的形式 第二点需要确定的是 平行论证必须显然是个谬论 对吧 如果你希望证明原论证是谬论 而且你通过 平行推理的方法证明这一点  那么你选择的平行论证必须是谬论 因为 否则的话 你无法证明原论证是谬论 

好了 第三个例子 不复合第二个标准 它的平行论证不确定是否是谬论 

好 

所以 这就是通过平行推理反驳 下一节课 我们将考虑反驳论证的其他方式 我们下次见。

### False Dichotomy

Today we're going to talk about false dichotomies. A false dichotomy is something that can go wrong with an argument, but it can go wrong either with an argument that we're trying to refute, and so we can refute that argument by showing that it depends on a false dichotomy, but it can also go wrong with the argument that we're giving by way of refutation, in other words, our attempted refutation of an argument can go wrong because it relies on a false dichotomy. 

So, what's a false dichotomy and why is it a bad thing? Let's talk about that now. A false dichotomy is when, an argument relies upon a false dichotomy when that argument falsely assumes that there are only two possibilities, when in fact, there are more than two possibilities. 'Kay? This is a common problem with arguments. It's a common problem with arguments that we try to refute and it's also a common problem with arguments that try to refute them. Let's look at some examples. 

So consider the following argument. You can imagine someone from, let's say, a powerful western nation giving the following argument in the course of determining which alliances to foster and which international relations to cutoff. 

Either other nations are with us or they're against us in our war against terrorism. That's premise one. Premise two, Switzerland is not with us. In conclusion, Switzerland is against us. And then, from this conclusion, you can imagine that the proponent of this argument would draw various further conclusions like the diplomatic relations with Switzerland should be cut off, the trade relations with Switzerland should be cut off and so forth. Maybe we should have an embargo on Swiss goods. 

So, the problem with this argument is that, even if premise two of the argument is true and, actually, even if premise three of the argument is true, premise one of the argument is a false dichotomy, or at least may very well may be a false dichotomy. Isn't it possible that a nation might simply be neutral, with respect to a particular conflict that our nation has with some other force, right? Couldn't a nation simply be neutral with respect to that conflict? Why must they choose between being with us and being against us? Why couldn't they just remain neutral? Right? So this argument relies on a false dichotomy and we can refute the argument by showing that it relies on a false dichotomy. 

Here's another example of an argument that relies on a false dichotomy. 

So imagine someone argues as follows. Premise one, either the government must listen in to our phone calls or else, they will be collecting our body parts after another terrorist attack. 

Premise two, better to listen in to our phone calls than to collect our body parts, right, rather lose our privacy than lose our lives. 

Conclusion, the government must listen in to our phone calls. 

Now again, let's suppose that premise two is true. In fact, we can even suppose that the conclusion is true. 

But even if the conclusion is true, this argument does not successfully show that the conclusion is true. And the reason it doesn't successfully show that the conclusion is true is that premise one, again, is a false dichotomy. Premise one assumes that there are only two possible situations, either the government is listening in to our phone calls or there's going to be another terrorist attack and the government will have to collect our body parts. But why are those two the only possible situations? Is there absolutely no other way of preventing another terrorist attack or, in any case, reducing the likelihood of another terrorist attack without listening in to our phone calls? Until someone can establish that there is no other possible way of doing that, we can suspect that premise one of this argument is a false dichotomy, and so the argument is unsuccessful. The argument doesn't show that 

its conclusion is true even if its conclusion is true. So those are two examples of arguments that rely on a false dichotomy. 

Now, I'd like you to look at the following video clip, in which you'll hear three arguments given. Now, the first of the three arguments is an appeal to popular opinion, but then, I think you'll see some examples of false dichotomy. Okay, we'll talk about it right after the video clip is over. 

You know that we don't catch that fishing boat, there ain't going to be no deep sea fishing. We'll have to stay in a dock that the old people are. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. What are you doing here? >> What? >> What about the other foot? >> [LAUGH] >> There ain't no sock on it. >> I'll get to it. >> [LAUGH] >> Don't you know that the whole world puts on a sock and a sock and a shoe and a shoe? >> [LAUGH] >> I like to take care of one foot at a time. >> [LAUGH] >> That's the dumbest thing I ever heard in my life. >> [LAUGH] >> It's just as quick my way. >> Wait a minute. That ain't the point. You see what I'm doing. Don't keep doing it. Listen to me. >> [LAUGH] >> Suppose there's a fire in the house and you gotta run for your life. 

Your way, all you got on is one shoe and a sock. 

My way, you got on a sock and a sock. You 

see, you're even. >> [LAUGH] >> Suppose it's raining or snowing outside. >> [COUGH] >> Your way, with a sock on each foot, my feet would get wet. My way, with a sock and a shoe on one foot, I can hop around and stay dry. >> [SOUND] >> I think you've been hopping around on your head. >> [LAUGH] >> Wait a, wait a, listen to me. >> [LAUGH] 

Supposing the other sock's got a hole in it. >> It doesn't have a hole in it. >> I said supposing it's got a hole in it. >> Alright. Suppose it has a hole. >> Alright. It's got a hole in it. So you ain't got another matching pair. So, what are you going to do? Your way, you're going to take off a whole shoe and a sock. My way, all you gotta do is take off one sock. >> [LAUGH] >> All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll start all over again. >> No, no, no. >> [LAUGH] >> You're half way through. Now, jeez, get on with it. We're in a hurry. >> [LAUGH] >> You can start doing it the right way tomorrow morning. And do it that way for the rest of your life. >> [SOUND] >> All the Americans are going to recognize that video clip as from a TV show called All in the Family which aired in the 1970s in the United States. The older character with white hair is named Archie and the younger character with brown hair and a mustache is named Michael. Now in that clip, Archie gives Michael three arguments for the conclusion that Michael ought put on a sock and a sock and a shoe and a shoe, in contrast to the way Michael's actually doing it, which is to put on a sock and a shoe and a sock and shoe. 

Now the first of those three arguments is just an appeal to popular opinion and goes like this. Premise, the whole world puts on a sock and a sock and a shoe and a shoe. 

Conclusion, Archie doesn't spell out this conclusion, but clearly, it's the conclusion that he wants Michael to draw, you, Michael ought to put on a sock and a sock and a shoe and shoe. Since, after all, that's how the whole world does it. 

Now, that's an appeal to popular opinion and, clearly, it's fallacious. Just because the whole world does it, doesn't provide a reason for you to do it. Of course, if there's a good reason to why the whole world does it that way, then whatever that good reason is, that might also be a good reason for you to do it that way. But, the fact that the whole world does it that way, by itself, that's not a good reason for you to do it that way. There might be evidence that there is a good reason, but, by itself, it's not a good reason. And so Michael says, I like to take care of one foot at a time. Perfectly good rebuttal to that argument. Okay. Now that's an appeal to popular opinion and it's a fallacy of relevance and those we discussed last week. 

But the next two arguments are interesting examples of false dichotomy arguments. Let's consider each one of them. 

So, in the next argument, Archie says the following. Premise one, if you have to rush out of the house halfway through putting on your footwear, well, either your feet will each have a sock on them or one foot will have a sock and shoe on it and the other foot will have nothing on it. 'Kay? Premise two, better for your feet to be even than to not be even. 

Let's suppose that's true. 

And so, conclusion, better to put on both your socks first. 

Okay. Now. 

This argument is a fallacy. And it's a fallacy even if premise two is true I don't know if premise two is true, but even if premise two is true and even if the conclusion is true, the argument is still a fallacy. And it's a fallacy because premise one and premise two, together, don't support the conclusion. See, premise one says, if you're under certain circumstances, namely, you have to rush out of the house halfway through putting on your footwear, then, either your feet will each have sock or one foot will have a sock and a shoe and the other will have nothing. 

Okay, that's right, and maybe it is true that it's better for your feet to be even than not. That doesn't mean that it's better, all things considered, to put on both your socks first, because, what if you don't have to rush out of the house halfway through putting on your footwear? I mean, Archie considers the case in which you do have to rush out of the house halfway through putting on your footwear, but first of all, that situation is one that's extremely unlikely to be the case. And secondly, he pays no attention to what would happen, what the consequences would be, of the different courses of action when that situation isn't the case, in other words, when you don't have to rush out of the house halfway through putting on your footwear. 

So, this is a false dichotomy, not because premise one is false, but because, in the transition from the two premises to the conclusion, what Archie loses track of is that premise one is true only given the condition that you have to rush out of the house halfway through putting on your footwear, right? So, if you're in that situation, if you have to rush out of the house halfway through putting on your footwear, then, the following two are the only possibilities, you have a sock and a sock or you just have a sock and a shoe. Those are the only two possibilities if you have to rush out of the house halfway through putting on your footwear. But, if we don't restrict ourselves to considering, 

the situation which you have, what, we have to rush out of the house halfway through putting on your footwear, then we see that there are lots more possibilities. You could have to rush out of the house a quarter of the way through putting on your footwear or three quarters of the way through putting on your footwear or immediately after putting on your footwear or maybe you don't have to rush out of the house at all. 

So there are all sorts of other possibilities, in which the dichotomy that Archie lists in premise one, the dichotomy either you have a sock and a sock or you have a sock and a shoe, in which that dichotomy just doesn't hold, in which there's a third possibility on top of the two possibilities that Archie mentions. 

And Michael, interestingly, tries to show that Archie's argument is no good by giving his own argument of exactly the same form with an incompatible conclusion that it's better to put on a sock and a shoe first. Remember, on Michael's alternative argument, he says, well, suppose you have to rush out of the house halfway through putting on your footwear but it's raining outside, right? If you have a sock and a sock, then both your feet will get wet whereas, if you have a sock and a shoe, then you can hop around on one foot and stay dry. 

So, that's an argument of the same form as Archie's argument, but it reaches an incompatible conclusion, the conclusion, namely, that it's better to put on a sock and a shoe and a sock and a shoe rather than a sock and a sock and and a shoe and a shoe. And that just shows that Archie's argument wasn't itself very compelling. 

Okay. So, that's Archie's second argument and that's guilty of a false dichotomy. Now, let's consider Archie's third argument, which goes like this. 

Premise one, if you find a hole in your second sock after putting on two socks, then you need only change your socks. Premise two, if you find a hole in your second sock after putting on a sock and a shoe, then you need to take off your shoe. 

Premise three, it's easier to take off two socks than a sock and a shoe. So, conclusion, better to put on your socks first. 

Okay now, Michael doesn't actually try to rebut this argument, but it's worth our while considering how compelling this argument is. 

See, this argument, like the one before it, also seems to rely on a false dichotomy. The false dichotomy is this. Under a certain circumstance, namely, when you find a hole in your second sock, one of two possible situations obtains, either, you only need to change your socks or, you need to take off your shoe in addition to changing your socks. So, under that scenario, when you find a hole in your second sock, then there are only two possible outcomes, you have to change your socks or you have to take off your shoe in addition to changing your socks. Okay, now, that might be right. Well, actually, it's not right because you do have the alternative of simply walking around with your hole, with a hole in your second sock or of just having unmatched socks. 

But let's suppose we rule that out somehow, we rule out the acceptability of walking around with unmatched socks or with a hole in your second sock. 

So we allow that, under the circumstances that Archie envisages, mainly, where you find a hole in your second sock, only one of two possible scenarios can obtain, either you have to change your two socks or you have to take off your shoe in addition to changing your socks. 

Okay. So, there's a dichotomy. But, its a dichotomy, that obtains only when we're in the situation that Archie specified, namely, where we find a hole in our second sock. But what if we don't find a hole in our second sock? Then there are any number of situations that could obtain, like we could end up putting on our socks and shoes and not having to change anything, or we could end up changing one sock after finding a hole in our first sock. We could end up having to take off our shoe after we find, not that there's a hole in our second sock, but that the first shoe doesn't feel comfortable with the first sock. There are any number of scenarios that could obtain, but Archie restricts himself to considering just two possible scenarios, the one where you have to change your two socks versus the one where you have to change your two socks and take off your shoe and he restricts himself to considering just those two possible scenarios because he's only thinking about a situation In which, what prompts you to change your footwear is finding a hole in your second sock. He's not considering any other possible situation. And so, once again, in this instance, he's guilty of a false dichotomy. He's arguing that it's better to put on your socks first, but he's arguing that by showing that, given a certain pair of options, that's the pair of options that you're facing when you find a hole in your second sock, given just that pair of options, it's better to put on your socks first. But why are those two the only possible options? Archie doesn't tell us that. That's what makes his argument a bad argument. 

Okay. So I hope I've given some real life examples here of false dichotomies that can occur in arguments and that can vitiate those arguments, that can make them bad arguments. Okay. Now in the exercises, we'll consider more examples of that. 

### Reductio Ad Absurdum

Today we're going to talk about a kind of refutation that we call a reductio ad absurdum. 

Now what's a reductio ad absurdum, and why does it have such a mysterious name? 

Lets begin with the definition. So reductio ad absurdum is a Latin phrase that means reduce to absurdity. And that's what a reductio ad absurdum is. It's a refutation of an argument that focuses on a particular claim in that argument, either one of the premises or the conclusion, and it shows that that claim, that proposition implies some absurdity. And since it implies some absurdity, the claim itself has to be false. Because nothing that's true can imply something that's obviously false. Only something that's false can imply something that is obviously false. 

And so, if you do a reductio ad absurdum on a proposition, you show that the proposition is false. And if that proposition is one of the premises, or the conclusion of an argument, then you've refuted that argument. You've shown that that argument is unsuccessful. 

Okay, so that's a reductio ad absurdum. Let's look as some examples. 

So consider this argument. Premise One, the best way to fight theft is to eliminate the conditions that make it possible. 

Premise Two, the use of a tangible media of exchange like cash, let's say, or gold, is a condition that makes theft possible. Right, with-, without a tangible media of change, there can't be any theft. 

Conclusion, therefore, the best way to fight theft is to eliminate tangible media of exchange. Now, I've actually heard this argument before. The argument is that if all exchanges, all transactions take place electronically. Let's say in a way that's traceable by your fingerprint or by your retinal scan, or something like that. If there's no cash, if there's no tangible medium of exchange, then we eliminate the black market and all kinds of goods and services. And, we also eliminate the violent crime that's associated with stealing cash. 

Okay. 

So, the conclusion of this argument might be true. 

In any case, it might true for all I'm going to say here. But what I want to point out right now is that we can use reducto ad absurdum to show that premise one of this argument is false. So, whatever else is true about the conclusion of the argument, premise one of the argument is false. And so the argument itself does not succeed in proving its conclusion. So, why do I say premise one of the argument is false? That the best way to fight theft is to eliminate the conditions that make it possible? Well, if that were true, then think about the various conditions that make theft possible. One of the conditions that makes theft possible is oxygen. 

Or water. Or any of the conditions that make human life on the earth possible. 

Right? Without those conditions, of course, theft wouldn't be possible. 

So, that would imply, premise one would imply that the best way to fight theft is to eliminate the conditions like oxygen, like water, that make theft possible. 

That's clearly not the best way to fight theft. It of course would be a way to fight theft. But, it's not the best way. 

So, premise one implies something that's obviously false. Namely that the best way to fight theft would be to eliminate oxygen and to eliminate water, that's obviously false. And, so premise one itself must be false because nothing that's true could imply something that's obviously false. 

Okay, so that's an example of how we can refute this argument using reductio ad absurdum to show the premise one of the argument is false. 

Here's another example. 

So consider this argument premise, if you count long enough you will eventually run out of numbers to count. In conclusion, therefore counting is an activity that cannot go on forever. 

Now this argument is valid, but the premise of the argument isn't true and so the argument isn't sound. Why is the premise of the argument not true? Why is it not true that if you count long enough you'll eventually run out of numbers to count? 

Well, here's a way to see that its not true. 

Suppose, for a moment that it were true, that if you count long enough, you'll, you'll eventually run out of numbers to count. Suppose that were true, well then there would be some last number, some greatest number. Now, whatever that number is, call it n. 

But now whatever that number is, we can just add one to it. 

Right? Addition is going to be defined over that number, that number n, whatever n is, and one. So we can add one to n, and now we come up with a greater number. 

So if this premise were true, then it would imply something that's inconsistent with the premise, namely that there's a larger number than n. 

So, the premise can't be true, because it implies something that's inconsistent with the premise itself. 

So, the premise is false and that shows that the argument is unsuccessful. So, we just did a reductio ad absurdum of the premise of our argument. Now I just gave a couple of examples of reductio ad absurdums that work. But not every attempt at reductio ad absurdum works. 

Consider this one. 

Premise, some things exist even though no one is thinking of them. Conclusion, therefore, reality exceeds the reach of the mind. 

There's more to reality than there is in the mind. 

Now suppose someone challenges the premise of this argument as follows. They say, look, you're saying that some things exist even though no one is thinking of them, but as you're saying that, presumably you're not just mouthing the words. You're really thinking it. You're thinking that some things exist even though no one is thinking of them. 

But if you're thinking that proposition, then you are thinking of those things. So whatever those things are that illegibly exist, even when no one is thinking of them, well you're thinking of them right now. 

And so the proposition that you're thinking namely that some things exist even when no one is thinking of them. That proposition is not true, because you're thinking of those very things right now. 

Those very things that exist even though allegedly no one is thinking of them. 

Okay, now, I leave it as an exercise for you to work out and for you all to discuss with each other in the forums. What's wrong with this attempt at a reductio ad absurdum of the premise of this argument? 

I'll let you think about that. See you next time. 

今天我们要来讨论几种 反驳方式 叫做归谬法 

什么是归谬法？ 为何它有一个如此神秘的名字？ 

首先来看一下定义 归谬法得名於一个拉丁短语 意思是 归纳为谬论 这就是归谬法 它是一种论证的反驳 关注论证中某个特定的主张 可能是前提之一 或是结论 并且显示该主张 该命题隐含着谬论 既然它隐含着某些谬论 该主张自身一定是错误的 因为没有任何正确的命题可以隐含明显的错误 只有错误的命题才会隐含明显的错误 

所以 如果你用归谬法 检验一个命题 就能说明该命题是错误的 并且如果那个命题是前提之一 或是一个论证的结论 那么你就能反驳该论证 你已经说明该论证是不成功的 

好 这就是归谬法 我们来看几个例子 

请看这个论证 前提一 遏制偷窃最好的方法 是消除一切使它存在的条件 

前提二 交易的有形媒介如 现金 比如说 或黄金 是使偷窃存在的条件之一 如果没有交易的有形媒介 就不会有 偷窃 

结论 所以 遏制偷窃最好的方法 就是消除交易的有形媒介 我以前确实听到过这种论证 该论证说 如果所有交易以电子形式处理 比如说以一种可追踪的方式 指纹 或视网膜扫描 或类似的方式 如果没有现金 如果没有交易的有形媒介 那么我们就消除了 黑市交易和所有产品及服务 同时也消除了与偷窃现金有关的暴力犯罪 

好 

所以 这个论证的结论可能是正确的 

无论如何 它可能是正确的 但我现在想指出的是 我们可以用 归谬法来说明这个论证的前提一是错误的 所以 无论该论证的结论如何正确 它的前提一都是错误的 因此 该论证本身也没有成功证明自己的结论 那么 为什么我说该论证的前提一是错误的呢 即遏制偷窃最好的方法 就是消除使它存在的一切条件 好 如果那是正确的 想一想 使偷窃存在的许多条件 使偷窃存在的条件之一是氧气 

或水 或任何 使人类得以生存在地球上的条件 

对吧? 如果没有这些条件 当然 偷窃不会存在 

所以 这就说明 条件一隐含了遏制偷窃最好的方法 是消除像氧气或水之类使偷窃存在的条件 

这明显不是遏制偷窃最好的方法 这当然是一种 遏制偷窃的方法 但 不是最好的方法 

所以 前提一隐含着一些明显的错误 即遏制偷窃最好的方法是 消除氧气或水 这是明显的错误 所以 前提一本身一定是错误的 因为 没有任何正确的命题可以隐含明显的错误 

好了 这就是一个我们如何反驳论证的例子 通过用归谬法说明该论证的前提一是错误的 

来看另一个例子下面再举另一个例子 

考虑一下这个论证的前提 如果你计数 足够久 最后将会用尽数字 无数可计 结论是 所以计数是一种不会永久继续的行为 

现在这个论证是有效的 但论证的前提 不正确 所以该论证不可靠 为什么该论证的前提不正确？ 为什么如果你计数 足够久就会用尽数字是不正确的？ 

这里有一种检验它是否正确的方法 

假设 有那么一个瞬间它是正确的 如果你 计数足够久 最后将会用尽数字 无数可计 假设这是正确的 那么 就会存在某个最后的数字 某个最伟大的数字 无论那个数字是什么 称它为n 

但无论那个数字是多少 我们都能给它加上一 

对吧? 定义加法在 那个数字n 不论n是多少 和一之间 所以我们可以把N加上一 就得出一个更伟大的数字 

所以如果这个前提时正确的 那么 它就隐含了前后矛盾 即是有 一个比n更大的数字 

所以 这个前提不可能是正确的 因为它 隐含了本身的自相矛盾 

所以 前提是错误的 这也说明该论证是不成功的 所以 我们在这个论证的前提上使用了归谬法 我刚刚给了一些可以使用归谬法的例子 但不是任何使用归谬法的尝试都会有用 

考虑一下这个 

前提 有些东西即使在没有人考虑到它们的情况下仍然存在 结论 所以现实超出思想所及 

现实中存在着比思想更多的东西 

现在假设有人以如下方式挑战这个论证的前提 他们说 看 你说有些东西即使没人 考虑到它时也存在 但正在你这么说的时候 想必不是只是动动嘴巴而已 你真的在思考这句话 你在思考 有些东西即使在没人考虑到它时仍然存在 

但如果你在思考这个命题 那么你就在思考那些东西 所以不论那些存在性模糊的东西是什么 即使没有 别人在思考它们 你现在就在思考它们 

所以你在思考的命题 即有些 东西即使在没人考虑到时仍然存在 这个命题不是正确的 因为你 现在就在思考这些东西 

那些即使据说没人考虑到时仍然存在的东西 

好 现在我把它当做一项作业留给你解决 让你们大家在论坛互相讨论 这个尝试出了什么问题 即在这个论证的前提上使用归谬法？ 

我会让你考虑一下的 下次见 


### Counterexamples

Today we're going to talk about how to refute an argument, by using counterexamples. 

So what's a counterexample and how does it help to refute an argument? A counter example is an example that runs counter to some generalization, and thereby shows that the generalization that's false. 

Now counterexamples can be used to refute an argument that contains a generalization, either as one of its premises or as its conclusion. So, if the argument contains a generalization as its conclusion, and the counterexample shows that the generalization is false, then in effect what the counter example does is show that the argument reaches a false conclusion. If the argument contains a generalization as one of it's premises, then the counterexample shows that that premise of the argument is false. But either way, the counterexample shows that the argument is unsuccessful, either because the argument has a false a premise or because its conclusion is false. 

Okay. So what are some examples of counterexamples? 

Well, let's start by considering this argument. Premise one, you should always treat others the same way that you would like to be treated yourself. 

Premise two, I would not like anyone to change my diapers. 

So conclusion, I should not change the baby's diapers. 

Now, this argument appears to be valid. Furthermore, I can assure you, premise two is true. 

So if premise one is also true, then it looks like I have a good argument for why I shouldn't change the baby's diapers. I should get someone else to do it. 

But is premise one true? 

Well, premise one sounds familiar enough. You should always treat others the same way that you would like to be treated yourself. That's something we frequently hear people say but that can't be precisely true. 

After all I would like to be treated as an adult but that doesn't mean that I should treat my children as adults right? So if the generalization is that you should always treat others the same way that you would like to be treated yourself that generalization is false. It's false even though I would like to be treated as an adult, it doesn't mean I should treat my children as adults. I shouldn't treat my children as adults because they're not adults, but I am. Now that doesn't meant that I should baby my children. 

But I shouldn't treat them the same way that I would like to be treated myself. I shouldn't treat them as if they're adults. 

Okay, so that's a counter example to premise one. 

And that counterexample shows that premise one stated in the way that it's stated here, you should always treat others the same way that you would like to be treated yourself. Premise one stated in that way is false and so this argument does not work. This argument does not succeed in showing that I should not change the baby's diaper, first the reason it doesn't succeed is because one of its premises is false. Now, premise one might seem to be true, but if it seems to be true, that's only because something very similar to premise one is true. What's similar to premise one that is true is the claim that you should usually typically often treat others the same way that you would like to be treated yourself. 

Now those claims are true you should usually treat others the same way that you'd like to be treated yourself. But that doesn't mean that you should always treat others the way you'd like to be treated yourself. That general claim about how you should always behave. That claim is false, and our counterexample shows it. There's an example of the use of counterexample to refute an argument. 

Let's consider another example. 

Consider this argument. Premise one, if it's wrong for all of us to perform a particular action then it's wrong for any of us to perform that action. Premise two, it's wrong for all of us to try to take the last piece of bread on the table. So conclusion it's wrong for any of us to try to take the last piece of bread on the table, you could imagine this situation. Let's say, a bunch of us are sitting around the dinner table eating dinner. There's a basket of bread in the middle of the table and we've been bit by bit reaching in to take out pieces of bread. And now there's only one piece of bread left in the basket and there are a bunch of us sitting around the table. Well it would be wrong for all of us to jump up and grab that piece of bread and start fighting over it. That would be wrong. That would be completely unacceptable. 

But just because that would be unacceptable, does that mean that none of us is allowed to go and eat that last piece of bread? 

Well, no. That seems like a preposterous conclusion. I mean, if all of us have to sit there just staring at that last piece of bread and none of us is allowed to eat it, well, then that's wasting food. 

That's not an acceptable conclusion. 

So, it's gotta be okay for one of us to take that last piece of bread even though it's not okay for all of us to try to take that last piece of bread. 

So here's an example where It's okay for one person to do something even though it's not okay for everyone simultaneously to do that thing. It's okay for one, it's not okay for everyone. 

So that's a counterexample to the generalization that occurs in premise one of our argument. So this argument is not a successful argument. This argument does not prove that it's wrong for any of us to try to take the last piece of bread on the table. And the reason it doesn't prove that is not because the argument is fallacy. The reason it doesn't prove that is because premise one of the argument is false. Premise one of the argument states a general claim. And that general claim that it states does not true. Well, that might be true that it's usually wrong for anyone to perform an action that is wrong for everyone to perform. It's not true that it's always wrong for anyone to perform an action that it's wrong for everyone to perform. And in fact I just gave a counter example to that generalization. It's not wrong for what one person to take a piece of bread, the last piece of bread on the table even though it would be wrong for everyone to try to take that piece of bread simultaneous. 

Okay, so there's another example of an argument that we can refute by means of counter example. We can use a counter example to show that premise one of that argument is false, and so the argument is unsuccessful. 

Finally, let's consider this third case. 

Premise one, breaking the law is almost always wrong. 

Premise two, double parking is breaking the law. 

So conclusion, double parking is almost always wrong. 

Now, can we refute this argument by means of counterexample? 

Well, There's no counter example to premise two. Premise two is simply true, double parking is breaking the law. That's part of what's involved in double parking. When you double park, you are breaking the law. Well what about premise one? Breaking the law is almost always wrong. 

Is there a counter example to that? No. There's no counter example to premise one that's stated. 

If premise one were to say breaking the law is always wrong, 

then we could produce a counter example to premise one. Sometimes, it's an emergency. You have no choice but to double park. You need to do something very quickly. It's not wrong to double park in that situations especially not if you're doing it in just a few seconds. It's not wrong to double park, and yet you're breaking the law because there's a law against double parking. 

So if premise one were to say breaking the law is always wrong, then there would be a counterexample to premise one. But premise one doesn't say that. Premise one says that breaking the law is almost always wrong. 

Now how to you produce a counterexample to a claim of the form almost always? 

Well the answer is you don't, because even if you produce an example of a case where breaking the law is not wrong, that still doesn't show that it's false, that breaking the law is almost always wrong. Maybe breaking the law is almost always wrong but just not in the case that you produced. 

So you can't produce a counterexample to a generalization of the form, breaking the law is almost always wrong. 

That generalization might be false, but you can't show that it's false by using a counterexample. 

Okay, so we cannot refute this argument by means of counterexample. That's not to say that this is a good argument. In fact, this third argument is not a good argument. 

But we can't show that it's not a good argument by using a counter example. So sometimes counterexample can succeed in refuting an argument, and sometimes it can't. It depends on whether the argument contains a generalization to the effect that something always happens or something is true in all cases. If the argument contains a generalization like that, an unexceptional generalization, a generalization without any room for exceptions, then the counter example can be used to refute that generalization. But if a generalization is phrased in such a way that it admits of exceptions, like if a generalization talks about what almost always happens or about what usually happens, about what typically happens, then we can't refute that generalization by means of counterexamples. Okay, so we can look at examples of counterexamples in the exercises that follow. See you next time. 

今天我们将讨论如何 使用反例来反驳一个论证 那么什么是反例以及它是如何帮助我们反驳论证的呢 

一个反例就是一个某些归纳的反面的例子 并通过这样证明归纳是错误的 

现在 反例可以用来反驳包含了归纳的论证 无论是在论证的前提中包含还是在结论中 那么 如果论证的结论包含了归纳 而且反例证明了归纳是错误的 那么 从效用上讲 反例的作用是 证明了论证产生了一个错误的结论 如果论证的前提包含了归纳 那么反例就证明了论证的前提是错误的 但是 无论哪种情况下 反例都是证明了论证不成立 要么是因为论证的前提错了 要么是因为结论错了 好吧 那么 有哪些反例的例子呢 

好吧 我们先来考虑这个论证 前提之一 你应该时时刻刻像对待自己 一样地对待别人 

前提2 

我不希望其他任何人换我的尿布 

所以结论是 我不应该换婴儿的尿布 

现在 这个论证看起来是有效的 不仅如此 我可以保证 前提二是正确的 

那么 如果前提一也是正确的 那看起来 我就有了一个好的论证说明为什么我不应该换婴儿的尿布 我应该让别人来做这件事 但是前提一是真的吗 

好吧 前提一听起来很耳熟 你应该时时刻刻像对待自己 一样地对待别人 我们常听到人们这么说 但是这并不是真的 毕竟 我希望被当成 一个成年人来对待 但这不意味着我要把我的孩子当成成年人 对吧 所以 像待人如待己这种归纳 其实是错误的 它之所以错误 是因为虽然我 希望被当做成年人 但不能说明 我应该把我的孩子当成成年人 我并不能把我的孩子像成年人一样对待 因为他们的确未成年 

但我成年了 

现在 不是说我要把我的孩子当成婴儿 

但我不应该像对待我自己一样对待他们 我不该把他们 当成大人一样对待 

好吧 这就是一个前提一的反例 这个反例证明了如之前描述的 那个前提 即 你应当待人如待己 你应当待人如待己 前提一 是错误的 所以论证并不成立 这个论证并无法证明 我不应该换婴儿的尿布 

它之所以无法证明 是因为它的一个前提是假的 现在 前提一似乎是真的 但是如果只是似乎的话 只能说明有种很类似前提一的东西是真的 而这个类似前提一的真的论述是你应该常常 准确的说经常像对待自己 一样地对待别人 

现在 这个论述是真的 你应当经常像对待自己 一样地对待别人 但这不意味着你应当总是 待人如待己 那个关于你应带总是如何做事的泛化的论证 是假的 并且我们的反例证明了这一点 

所以 就有了一个用反例来反驳论证的例子 

我们再来看看另一个例子 

考虑如下的论证 前提一 如果所有人都做某个特定的行为是错的 那么任何一个人做这种行为也是错的 

前提二 所有人都去拿桌子上的 最后一片面包是不对的 所以 结论 任何一个人去拿桌子上的 最后一片面包是不对的 

你可以想象这个情形 比如说我们一群人 坐在餐桌边吃晚餐 有一个篮子的面包放在桌子中央 而我们一片一片从中间拿面包并吃掉了 现在篮子里只剩下最后一片面包 还有一群人围着桌子坐着 好吧 如果我们所有人都跳起来抢最后一块面包 并开始为之大打出手 那肯定是不对的 所以这一定是错误的 那是完全不能被理解接受的 但是仅仅因为这种行为不能被接受 难道这意味着 我们中不能有人去拿走并享用最后一片面包吗 

不是 那看起来是一个很荒谬的结论 我是说 如果我们都要坐着盯着 最后一片面包 而且任何人都不许吃它 这是在浪费食物 这个结论我们无法接受 

所以 我们中间有一个人拿走最后的面包是可以被允许的 即使我们所有人都去拿最后的面包是不恰当的 

所以 这就是一个人可以做 但是不能 所有人同时做一件事的例子 

对么 一人可为 不可皆为 

所以 这就是一个对论证的前提一 中的归纳的反例 所以这个论证不是一个成立的论证 这个论证并不能证明 我们中间任何一个人去拿最后一片面包是不低的 而它不能证明的原因 不是因为论证是谬论 它不能证明的原因是 因为论证的前提一是错误的 论证的前提一论述了一个归纳 而那个归纳不是真的 好吧 也许下面的说法是真的 如果任何人做这件事都是错的 那么所有人都做这件事通常也是错的 但是如果说一个人做这件事是错的 所以所有人都做这件事一定是错的 这不是真的 事实上 我刚刚给出了这个归纳的反例 一个人拿走一片面包 桌上最后一片面包 不能算不对的 尽管所有人都 同时去拿最后一片面包是不对的 

好吧 这就是另一个我们可以 用举反例的方式来反驳论证的例子 我们可以用一个反例来证明 论证的前提一是错误的 因此 论证不成立 

最后 让我们来考虑第三个例子 

前提一 违法几乎都是不对的 前提二 平行停车是违法的 所以 结论是 平行停车几乎都是错的 

现在 

我们能不能用反例反驳这个论证呢 好吧 前提二找不到反例 前提二很简单 平行停车违法了 这就是平行停车的定义的一部分 当你平行停车 你就是违法了 

那么前提一呢 违法几乎都是错的 

有这一点的反例吗 不是的 没有前提一的反例 如果前提一说违法一定是不对的 

那么我们就有前提一的反例了 有时候事出紧急 你除了平行停车别无选择 你必须马上做某些事情 在这种情况下 平行停车不是错的 尤其是当你只平行停车几秒钟时 这时平行停车并没有错 尽管你违法了 因为有法律禁止平行停车 所以 如果前提一是说 违法一定是不对的 那么就有了前提一的反例 但是前提一并不是这么说的 前提一说 违法几乎都是不对的 

现在 你能找到什么反例呢 在 几乎总是 的情形下 

好吧 答案就是找不到 因为就算你能找到一个违法但不能算错的例子 也不能说明前提错了 即违法几乎都是不对的 也许违法的确几乎都是不对的 但只有你的例子除外 

所以 你找不到一个关于 违法几乎都是错的 这个归纳的反例 

这个归纳也许是错的 但是你无法通过找反例来证明它错了 

好 所以我们无法用反例的方式反驳这个论证 但这不能说论证是强的 事实上 第三个论证并不强 只是我们 无法用反例的形式证明这一点而已 所以 有时候 反例能有效地 反驳一个论证 有时候不能 这取决于论证是否包含了一个特定的归纳 即某种事物总是发生或者在所有情况下都是对的的归纳 如果论证包含了这种归纳 一个没有例外的归纳 一个无法包含任何例外的归纳 那么反例就可以反驳这个归纳 但是如果一个归纳的描述 承认了例外的存在 比如如果一个归纳描述某事几乎总是发生 或者经常发生 通常发生 那么我们就不能通过反例来反驳这个归纳 好吧 我们可以在接下来的练习中 接着看看反例的例子 下节课见 

## The Pitfalls of Refutation

### Attacking a Straw Man

One problem that, that can arise when you try to refute an argument is that you end up attacking a straw man. 

Now, what does that mean? What is attacking a straw man? Let me start off by giving a definition and then giving some examples. 

So, to attack a straw man, is to misunderstand the argument or the hypothesis that you're attempting to refute. Right, you might try to refute an argument or show that a particular hypothesis is false. But if in the course of doing that you end up misunderstanding the argument of the hypothesis, then we say you're attacking a straw man. 

Here's some examples of that phenomenon. 

So imagine Walter and I are having a conversation and Walter claims the United States should not have sent in troops back in 2003 to depose the government of Saddam Hussein and Iraq I hear Walter say this and I respond by saying, oh, so Walter you must think that the suffering that Saddam Hussein imposed upon his citizens just doesn't count for anything. Okay, now clearly, I'm trying to criticize what Walter's saying but my criticism misunderstands what he's saying. Walter didn't say that the suffering that Saddam Hussein imposed upon his citizens doesn't count for anything. Walter just said, the United States should not have sent in ground troops in 2003 to depose the government of Saddam Hussein. Now, why does Walter think that? There could be a number of reasons why Walter thinks that. But his having reasons for thinking that is consistent with Walter's also thinking that the suffering that Saddam Hussein imposed upon his own citizens matters a lot. But maybe there would have been more effective ways to address that suffering without sending in ground troops to depose his government. 

So, until I understand better how Walter is defending his view that the United States should not have sent in troops to depose the government of Saddam Hussein, I'm attacking a straw man when I say oh so you must think that the suffering that he imposed upon the citizens doesn't count for anything. 

So there's one example of attacking a straw man. Here's another example. Suppose once again Walter and I are having a conversation and I say we should distribute condoms to teenagers around the world in order to prevent unwanted pregnancies and all the tragic costs that result from unwanted pregnancies. And Walter says oh so you must want to encourage teenagers over the world to have as much sex as possible. 

Now there Walter's attacking the straw man. Right? Until he understands what my reasons are for thinking that we should distribute condoms to teenagers around the world, and until he can evaluate the benefits that I see to that policy against the possible costs of possibly making it easier for some teenagers to have sex, 

he can't simply assume that I want to encourage teenagers to have as much sex as possible. Maybe I don't want that. Maybe I don't want to encourage teenagers to have as much sex as possible, but I still think that it's a good idea to distribute condoms to teenagers around the world in order to prevent unwanted pregnancies. 

So, here's an example where Walter is attacking the straw man. 

Okay, now, in the video clip that follows, you're going to see David Mitchell, who's a British comedian, attacking another straw man. Let's take a listen [MUSIC]. >> Have you noticed its no longer good enough to try and live in such a way that pleases you and doesn't outrage others. No, as if this was too easy a goal and we needed a refinement on the human condition to make a sufficient challenge of it, we're now suppose to live in the moment. It's not enough to work towards being happy later. You have to be happy now. Right now. No, now. Not then, not soon, now. Well that's unfair of me. I realize most of the living in the moment-eers are not saying that's the only way of being happy that counts. Although, asterisk, some of them definitely are saying exactly that. They're recommending this as a way to become happy. Are they mad? Apart from the obvious paradox that anytime I'm checking to see if I'm living in the moment or not, I cease to live in the moment, or rather the moment I'm living in becomes the moment of checking, the range of pleasures available to people living in the moment is both small and well, best deal. Unless you're in the middle of something delicious, intoxicating, caramel or whatever the posh word for sneezing is, you're stuck. And out of those, the only one that requires no on in the moment planning or forethought whatsoever is sneezing. A nice though a good sneeze is after three they get annoying. And what's more, I don't think its as easy as all that to tell whether or not your enjoying a moment in that moment. I remember watching the film Mulholland Drive and believing that I was enjoying myself as I anticipated the dramatic ending that would cleverly resolve and make sense of this intriguing mystery. But there wasn't one, it just sort of stopped. And once I realized that I had no choice but to retrospectively downgrade what I had thought had been my enjoyment in the moment. My enjoyment was predicated on a demanding to something it was an IOU to be redeemed at the point of pleasurable revelation by which I don't mean the lesbian sex scene and as there was none, the IOU was never redeemed. Therefore, I haven't enjoyed myself where this is really starkly obvious of course is sport. Of the three big matches Andy Murray played this year, the one I enjoyed most at the time, by country mile, was his last Olympic game where he went into the lead early and stayed there until he won. 

The one I think I enjoyed most now is the US open. Where it was touch and go for hours, and then he won. Much more exciting, which is why I value it now, and hated it at the time. Because at the time, I had no way of knowing that the moment I was reluctantly suffering through wasn't a moment on a long and exhausting journey towards defeat. Like the Wimbledon final, which neither in the moment me nor looking back me enjoyed at all. At the time, when watching any sporting contest in which I'm partisan, I don't have the faintest idea if I'm enjoying myself. My dominant emotion is I really hope my team wins, so it will turn out later I'm enjoying myself now. 

That's the problem with living in the moment. We're too intelligent a species to be able to avoid living in some sort of narrative, and that involves not knowing how we feel in the moment until we have context for it. Too short-term a focus, and we've nothing to enjoy but sneezing. Too long term a context, and it's all a plan to enjoy something we never get to. And anyway, we'll all be dead within 100 years. We have no choice but to find some sort of medium term over which to give a shit, or nothing is anything. And once you've granted that, then all the delayed gratifications are variations on a theme. And the theme is, chores now for jam tomorrow. Whether it's, I want to build a cathedral, or I fancy a sandwich. You're stuck in the middle with me. [MUSIC] >> Now in the clip we just saw, David Mitchell gives two arguments against the advice to live in the moment. Now what are those two arguments? Well, here's one of them. It goes like this. Premise one, living in the moment involves a very restricted set of pleasures. Mitchell describes them as vestule. Premise two, a good life involves many pleasures outside that restricted range. 

And so conclusion a good life does not involve living in the moment. 

Okay. 

Now I hope it'll be clear once we set the argument out like that that this argument is not valid, this argument is not compelling at all Just because living in the moment involves a very restricted set of pleasures, and let's suppose for the moment that it does, and the good life involves many pleasures outside that restricted range, and let's grant that it does, it doesn't follow that a good life does not involve living in the moment. 

For all that we get from premise one and two. For all that those two premises tell us, it could be that good life involves living in the moment and a whole lot of other things as well, and a whole lot of other pleasures as well. Besides, living in the moment. 

So, this is an example of an argument that is not valid. 

But given how obvious the invalidity is, why does Mitchell think that this argument is worthwhile leveling against the proponent of living in the moment? 

He thinks it's worthwhile leveling against that proponent. Because he thinks that proponent is someone who says that a good life just involves the pleasures of living in the moment. But, that's a misunderstanding of what the proponent of living in the moment is saying. The proponent of living in the moment isn't saying that life doesn't involve any pleasures whatsoever over and above living in the moment. The proponent of living in the moment is simply saying that in addition to whatever other pleasures life involves, we need to remember the pleasures of living in the moment. 

Okay, that's one argument that Mitchell uses against the proponent of living in the moment, and that argument is guilty of attacking a straw man. Here's the other argument Mitchell uses against the proponent of living in the moment. It goes like this. Premise, living in the moment is ascertainable only after that moment. As Mitchell says. 

You can only check whether you are living in the moment if that moment that you're living in becomes one of checking. Conclusion, therefore living in the moment is impossible. 

Right. This is the paradox that Mitchell describes early in the clip. 

Now, how does it follow from the premise, living in the moment is ascertainable only after that moment? That living in the moment is impossible? How is this argument supposed to be a good one? 

Well, Mitchell's idea is if you're ascertaining whether your living in the moment then the moment that your living in becomes one of checking. And since checking isn't itself self pleasurable, you can't live in the moment. 

But, that doesn't follow because it leaves it open into the perponent of living in the moment to say. That you can only live in the moment when you're not checking whether or not you're living in the moment. The happiness that you can enjoy when you're living in the moment is not a happiness that you can enjoy while you're checking to see that you're having that happiness. It's a happiness that you can enjoy only when you're not preoccupied with checking to see that you have it. 

So, once again we have an invalid argument, and the invalid argument is badly directed against the proponent of living in the moment. Mitchell assumes that the proponent of living in the moment is affected by this argument because the proponent of living in the moment must think that living in the moment somehow requires knowing that you're living in that moment. And knowing that you're living in that moment somehow requires checking that you're living in that moment. But the proponent of living in the moment need require no such thing. The proponent of living in the moment might advise us to live in the moment without advising us to check whether we're living in that moment. Without advising us to think about whether we're living in that moment, but simply to live in that moment. 

And Mitchell's argument doesn't affect the view that we should live in the moment so long as that view isn't understood to be the view that we should check to see whether we're living in the moment. 

Okay. So, those are two examples of straw man arguments that occur in the clip that we just saw. Both of them arguments directed against the proponent of living in the moment, but both of them attack a straw man. In the exercises that follow we'll see some more examples of arguments that may or may not be attacking the straw man. 

当你试图反驳一个论点时 会产生一个问题 那就是你在“攻击一个稻草人” 

那么，那是什么意思？ 什么叫“攻击一个稻草人(稻草人谬误)” 我们先从定义入手然后会看几个例子 

攻击稻草人(稻草人谬误) 就是 误解了你要反驳的论点 或假设 你或许企图反驳一个论点 或者说明某个假设是错误的 但是如果在这个过程中你曲解了 假设的论点 那么我们就说你在攻击一个稻草人 

这里有几个发生这种现象的例子 

假设Walter和我正在 聊天 Walter说道 美国不应该 在2003年的时候派遣军队去反对 萨达姆侯赛因和伊拉克政府 我听到Walter这样说然后 我回应道 哦 那么Walter 你一定认为 萨达姆侯赛因施加于他们公民身上的痛苦无关紧要  好的 显然我在试图批驳 Walter的说法 但是我的反驳曲解了他的说辞 Walter没有说萨达姆侯赛因 施加于人民的痛苦不算什么  Walter只是说美国在2003年不应该派遣 陆地军队去反对萨达姆侯赛因政府 为什么Walter这样认为呢？ 这里面应该有许多原因 让他这样认为 不过使他这样认为的原因伴随着他认为  萨达姆侯赛因施加于人民的痛苦 是无关紧要的 不过或许有更有效的方法来处理 这些痛苦而不需要派兵去反对他的政府 

所以 在我更好地理解 Walter如何为他的观点 即美国不应该 派军反对萨达姆政府 辩护之前 当我说  “哦 你一定觉得 人民的痛苦不算什么”的时候 我就是在攻击稻草人 

好的 这就是一个攻击稻草人(稻草人谬误)的例子 来看另一个例子下面再举另一个例子 假设Walter和我有在聊天  我说我们应该向全世界的青少年派发避孕套以 避免意外怀孕以及所有 意外怀孕带来的惨重损失 Walter说 哦 你一定是想鼓励 全世界青少年尽可能多地进行性交往 

现在Walter就在攻击稻草人 对吧? 在了解我这样想 即我们 应该向全世界青少年派发避孕套的原因之前 在他能够 权衡我这个政策所能带来益处和便利了青少年 性交往这个弊处之前 

他不能简单地假设我想 鼓励青少年多进行性交往  或许我不希望这样 或许我并不想鼓励青少年过多地 性交往 但我仍然认为 向全世界青少年 发放避孕套来避免意外怀孕是个好主意 

这个例子中Walter就犯了稻草人谬误 

好的 在下面的视频片断中 你将  看到David Mitchell他是个英国的喜剧演员 他也犯了稻草人谬误  我们来听听 【教育无边界字幕组】翻译 pindao 校对 Edna 审阅 [音乐] 你们注意到了吗  让自己高兴而不惹恼别人的生活方式越来越难实现了  不 就好像这个目标很简单就能达成一样 我们需要重新设定 人类的状态 为了更有挑战性 假设我们现在就活在当下 为了以后的快乐而努力是不够的 你现在就得快乐  现在 就是现在 不是之后 不是过一会 而是现在 我不这么认为 我注意到这些活在当下者中的大部分 并没有说这是获得快乐的唯一方式 然而 这里是重点 他们中的有些人确实就是这个意思  他们向人们推荐这种获取快乐的方式 他们疯了吗？ 除开一个非常明显的悖论 即 当我查看 我自己是否活在当下 而这时我就停止了活在当下 或者当我活在当下的时候刚好是我 检查我自己状态的时刻 快乐的范围对于 那些活在当下的人们来说很微小且短暂 除非你正在享用美味的 令人陶醉 甜蜜的 事物  或者其他任何能够形容打了个喷嚏的华丽的辞藻你被缠住了 除开这些  事先计划准备什么的是打喷嚏 打一个喷嚏会觉得很爽 可连打三个之后就会让人觉得觉得很困扰 并且 我不认为 辨别你自己是不是在那个时刻很享受是件容易的事 我记得我在看穆赫兰道的时候 我认为我是很享受的 因为 我期待着戏剧性反转的结局 巧妙地 解开并解释这些谜团  可是结局不是这样的 它戛然而止了  当我察觉到这点时 我只能 又回过头来把我曾经认为很愉快的时刻 降级 不那么快乐了 我享受的是某种对某事物的期许 那是一种 等着欠条被偿清时的快感  我指的可不是同性恋之间的性交 场面 况且这也没在影片里出现 欠条根本就没有被兑现  因此我并不觉得享受 另外一个 很明显例子就是体育比赛 我最享受的比赛 是Andy Murray今年参与的三大战役中的一个 是他的最后一场奥林匹克比赛 在比赛中 他开局就领先一直保持到他获胜 

而我觉得现在我最享受的比赛是美国公开赛 那场比赛战况很胶着 持续了几个小时 最后他才获胜 (相比之下后者) 精彩多了 这也是为什么我现在欣赏它 而当时讨厌它的原因  因为当时我并不知道  我痛苦煎熬的那段时间是否会是 一个通往胜利的征程  像Wimbledon决赛 我在当时和之后 都不觉得享受 在观看有我方参加的体育比赛时 我没有下意识的认为我是否享受这个比赛  我的主要情绪是希望我的团队获胜 所以之后才能分辨出我是享受这个比赛的 

这就是 活在当下的问题 我们是个太具智慧的物种 能够避免活在某种狭隘视野中  而这涉及到我们并不知晓我们当时的感觉  知道我们有了“上下文”作参考  而太短暂的事物 我们无法从中获得享受 它就只像是打了个喷嚏  太长的前因后果 却是一个引领我们去往从未体验过的快乐的计划 无论如何 我们100年之内都会离开这个世界  我们除了寻找某种 中等长度的体验来经历外别无选择 一旦你承认了这一点 那么所有的 延迟的喜悦都不过是主题曲的变奏  而主题曲是 琐碎的当下 未知的明天 不管是否是这样 我想要建一座大教堂 或者 我想象一个三明治 你我都夹在其中 [背景音乐] 翻译: RyukaSuu |审阅: 19waa Coursera Global Translator Community 在我们刚才看到的视频中 David Mitchell给出了两个论点反驳  活在当下这个建议 这两个论点是什么呢？  这是第一个 它是这样说的 前提1 活在当下只能涉及到很有限的快乐  Mitchell将它们描述成  前提2 在那个有限的圈子之外幸福的人生中还有很多其他快乐 

结论是 一个幸福的人生不涉及活在当下 

好 

我希望我们列出论点之后大家都看明白了 这个论证是无效的 是不严谨的 因为活在当下涉及到很有限  快乐 并且让我们假设 美好的生活涉及到很多那些局限以外的愉悦 我们假设这是对的  可这并不能表明美好的生活不涉及活在当下 

我们从前提1和前提2能得出 从那两个前提能告诉我们的只有 美好的生活涉及到活在当下 和好多其他的事物  也包括好多其他的喜乐  除开活在当下以外的喜乐 

这就是个命题不成立的例子 

不过既然这个论证明显不成立 为什么Mitchell 认为这个论点足够反驳活在当下的支持者们呢？ 

他之所以认为这足以反驳那个观点的支持者 是因为他认为这个观点的支持者说美好的人生只 涉及当下的愉悦  而这正是曲解了 活在当下支持者们所说的言论 活在当下的支持者们并没有说人生 不涉及除了当下以外的喜乐  支持者只是说 在生活中的其他  欢愉的基础之上 我们需要  记住活在当下的快乐 

好的 这是Mitchell用来反驳活在当下支持者的论点之一  而这个论点犯了稻草人谬误 这里是Mitchell用来反驳活在当下这个建议的另一个论点 活在当下这个建议的另一个论点 这个理论是这样的 前提 活在当下是 正如Mitchell说的 

你只能在你确实生活的时刻 检查你是不是活在当下 结论 因此活在当下是不可能的 

对吧 这就是Mitchell在视频前面的部分提出的悖论 

它是如何从前提推出的的呢？  只有那个时刻过后才能确认是否活在当下 活在当下是不可能的？  为什么这个论点是成立的呢？ 

你看 Mitchell的意思是说如果你你在检查你时候活在当下  那么这个时刻你是在检查而不是活在当下 而因为检查本身不是一件开心的事情 你没法活在当下了 

不过这并不能由前提推出因为它把主动权 抛给了活在当下的支持者 他们可以说 当你不在检查自己是否活在当下时 你才活在当下 活在当下 你活在当下所享受到的幸福快乐并非  你在检查你是否 正在经历这个快乐所体会到的快乐 它是一种只有当你 不是全神贯地注检查自己是否拥有它时才能享受到的快乐 

所以这个论点也不成立 并且这个论点反驳的方向完全打偏了 活在当下 Mitchell认为活在当下的支持者 会被这个论点反驳到 因为支持者 一定认为活在当下  某种程度上需要知道你确实是活在当下的  而知道你是否活在当下  某种程度上需要检测你是否活在当下  可是活在当下的支持者并不需要检测  活在当下的支持者或许  建议我们活在当下 而并没有  建议我们检测我们是否活在当下  并没有建议我们想着我们是否 活在当下 而只是建议我们活在当下 

Mitchell的论点无法反驳我们 应该活在当下这个观点 因为这个观点  并不能被解释成 我们  应该检查我们是否活在当下 

好 以上就是视频中出现的 两个稻草人谬误的例子 这两个论点都在反驳活在当下的支持者  不过它们都犯了稻草人谬误  接下来的练习中我们会看到更多例子 它们可能犯了也或许没犯稻草人谬误 

## The Great Shave

### Why Walter Should Shave His Head

Okay. 

Finally, as the last argument in this course, is the one that bothers me most, and it comes from Lauren Brush. I think it must have bothered her too, because it's not clear that she was ever happy with the formulation and kept changing it. 

But I'm going to give a very simplified version of it and see if we can reconstruct it and determine whether it's really sound. 

This is what Lauren said, in my words not her's exactly. 

Walter wants to up the number of students, who get the most out of this class, now that's true. I want to increase the number of students who get the most out of this class. That's the point of teaching. 

Therefore, Walter should shave his hair on camera, and make the video open to all students. No, my beautiful locks no, that is what's upsetting. But luckily, luckily this argument's not valid, no way. It's possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. So, sorry Lauren. I'm not convinced. Uh-huh, she can add another premise. She's probably assuming this. 

More students will get the most out of this class if Walter shaves his hair on camera, and makes the video open to all students. Okay, I guess I gotta admit that too. I think people will get more out of the class if they see that, because part of what you get out of this class is you have some fun. At least I hope you've had fun. I have. 

Okay, Lauren. But still, still it's not valid. It's not valid. And so I'm not going to shave my head yet. No way, no way. Uh-oh. 

The main reason it wasn't valid was that the premises were about what I want, and the conclusion is about what I should do. But wait, now maybe it is valid. Sure it looks valid if we add one more suppressed premise. 

Walter should do what will accomplish, what he wants to do. My gosh. 

Then what I want to accomplish is to get more students get the most out of the class. 

If I should do what I want to do, then I should do what's going to make the most students get the most out of the class. If shaving my head is doing that, then it sure looks like I should shave my head on camera and make it open to all the students. 

I feel like I'm in trouble now. What's going to happen. 

Wait, wait I got it, even though it's valid premise three is not true. That I should do what's going to accomplish what I want. What if I want something like, I want to smoke, or maybe I shouldn't go to the store and get a pack of cigarettes, because even though I want to smoke I still shouldn't because it's bad for me, because it's going to hurt me. So it looks like you have to qualify that premise by saying that I should do what will accomplish what I want to do unless doing it has worse effects, like in smoking, where it might give me cancer and hurt me. So, now I'm safe. Now I don't have to shave my head. 

That makes me feel better because you can't get the conclusion that I should do it from those three premises, right? It's not valid anymore. Uh-huh, all we need is another premise. 

Walter shaving his hair, his head, on camera and making the video open to all students will not have worse effects. [SOUND] Uh-huh, because shaving my head is not going to give me cancer like smoking. Matter of fact, hair will grow back. 

It might be embarrassing for a few days, but only a few days. That's not that bad compared to all those students out there in Chriseraland. 

So I guess I have to admit that premise four is true. But wait a minute, if the argument is valid and premise four is true, and premise three is true, and premise two is true, premise one is true. 

Now it's looking good, and we can even break it up to make it easier to understand. I want the number of students to increase that get the most out of the course and more will get most out of the course if I shave my head on camera and make that video available. So shaving my hair on camera making the video available would give me what I want and I ought to do what I want if it doesn't cause worst harm. This is not going to cause worst harm so I ought to do it. My gosh, now I'm worried because that means that the conclusion is true. If the argument's sound, it's valid and the premises are true, then the conclusion's sound. 

Or at least if I accept the premises, and the conclusion follows validly then I'm committed to that conclusion. I'm committed to the fact that I should shave my hair on camera and distribute the video to all students so you can all watch it. Lauren has convinced me of that. But notice, this argument applies to me. It also applies to Ram. So if I've got to shave my head, Ram's got to shave his beard. 

So although I have to shave my head, at least I'm not alone. 

Guess we gotta both go do it.
