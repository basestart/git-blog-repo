# Representing Information

CONTENT: This week we will teach you how to use the tools that you’ve learned about in the preceding modules in order to represent information. Information can be communicated in very different ways – by means of different languages or signaling systems – but no matter how that information is communicated, it can be important to use that information in reasoning. In this week, you will learn how to reason from information that is communicated directly by means of truth-tables or Venn Diagrams.

LEARNING OUTCOMES: By the end of this week's material you will be able to:

understand the information conveyed by a Venn Diagram
use Venn Diagram to determine whether a deductive argument is valid

## Representing Information

### reasoning from Venn Diagrams or Truth Tables Alone

Over the past couple of weeks, we've seen how we can use truth tables and Venn diagrams to predict and explain the validity of arguments. But the arguments that we've looked at are all arguments that are given in ordinary language that we can understand. 

But of course not all arguments are like that. Some arguments are given in foreign languages that we don't understand. Or they're given in technical languages that we don't understand. 

Could you use Truth Tables or Venn diagrams to predict and explain the validity of those arguments? Even those arguments that are given in languages that you don't yet understand? 

Well, today I'm going to show you that you can, you can do that. And I'm going to show it by giving some examples. 

So let's start with a simple but fanciful example. 

So, suppose you're an anthropologist, you're a cultural anthropologist. You're studying some foreign culture and you're trying to translate their language. Because their language has been heretofore untranslated, so you go in and you're translating their language. You're figuring out what they mean by various words that they use. 

And you've translated most of their words, but there's this word they use, SPooG. And you haven't yet figured out what that means. And so you're observing their behavior and finally you come up with a hypothesis. 

[COUGH] and you're pretty confident of this hypothesis. Your hypothesis is that they use SPooG as a truth functional connective. 

And it's a truth functional connective that has this truth table. 

It connects two propositions to make a larger proposition. And that resulting proposition P SPooG Q, for whatever propositions P and Q SPooG is connecting. That resulting proposition is going to be true whenever P is true or whenever both P and Q are false. So the only scenario in which P SPooG Q is going to be false is where P is false and Q is true. 

So that's your hypothesis about what they mean by SPooG. 

Okay, now one day you hear one of the members of this foreign culture give an argument. And, using the translation manual that you've developed, you translate their argument as follows. 

John is riding his bicycle. SPooG Jill is walking to the park. 

Premise two, Jill is walking to the park therefore, John is riding his bicycle. 

Now, is this argument valid or invalid? Well, you can use the truth table for SPooG 

to figure out whether the argument is valid or invalid and also to see why. 

So, let's consider how the truth table would go. 

This is the truth table again for SPooG, applied to the case that we're considering. 

Well, premise one tells us that John is riding his bicycle SPooG, Jill is walking to the park. So if premise one is true, then we're either in this scenario, in this scenario, or in this scenario. 

Premise two tells us that Jill is walking to the park. So if premise two is true, then we're either in this scenario, or in this scenario. 

Okay, so what do premises one and two put together, what do they tell us? Well, premises one and two tell us that, first of all, we're not in this scenario. because in this scenario it's not going to be true that Jill is walking to the park. 

Again, premises one and two put together tell us that we're not in this scenario. because in this scenario, it's not going to be true that John is riding his bicycle SPooG Jill is walking to the park. 

Again, premises one and two tell us that we're not in this scenario. because in this scenario, it's not going to be true that Jill is walking to the park. So, if premises one and two are both true, that tells us that we've got to be in this scenario. 

But in this scenario, it's gotta be true that John is riding his bicycle. And so using the truth table for SPooG, 

you can figure out that this argument is valid. 

And you can explain why it's valid. 

See? So you can use the truth table for a truth functional connective that you don't have any understanding of independently of the truth table for it, right? It's not a connective that you use in your language. 

You can just use the truth table to figure out that a particular argument is valid. 

Let's try that with a more complicated case. 

Okay, so now suppose you hear some member of this foreign culture arguing as follows, at least according to your translation. John is riding his bicycle SPooG, Jill is walking to the park or Frank is sick. 

Frank is not sick, John is not riding his bicycle. 

Therefore, Jill is walking to the park. 

Okay, now is that argument valid or not? 

Okay, so let's look at this more complicated truth table. 

Okay so, premise three tells us that John is not riding his bicycle. So that tells us that we've got to be in one of these four scenarios. Premise two tells us that Frank is not sick. So that tells us that we've got to be in one of these four scenarios. And premise one tells us that John is riding his bicycle, SPooG, Jill is walking to the park, or Frank is sick. So that tells us that we've gotta be in one of these scenarios right here. 

Okay, so based on that information, what can we figure out? Well, we can immediately figure out that we're not in one of these top four scenarios. because in all of those top four scenarios, Frank is riding his bicycle, right? So premises one, two, and three together, rule out the top four scenarios. We can also figure out that we're not in scenarios five or seven because in scenarios five or seven, Frank is sick. 

So we can rule out those scenarios. 

And we can rule out the sixth scenario because in the sixth scenario it's not true that John is riding his bicycle SPooG, Jill is walking to the park, and Frank is sick. So based on the information that we get from premises one, two and three of the argument, we can deduce that we're in this last scenario. 

We've gotta be in this last scenario. And in this last scenario it's false that Jill is walking to the park, in other words, Jill is not walking to the park. 

But that's not what the conclusion of our argument says. So this argument, this more complex argument is not valid. And we can prove that as we just did using the truth table for SPooG and disjunction. 

Okay, now let me show how we can do the same thing with quantifiers. So imagine as you're translating this foreign language, you hear a word. It's always said in a high-pitched tone, an excited tone, Jid! 

And you wonder what does Jid mean? 

Well, after watching the way they use that word, you come up with a hypothesis. Your hypothesis is that when they use the word jid, they're using a quantifier. 

And the quantifier works like this. When you say Jid F or G, you're saying 

that there aren't any F that are outside the G category. But there is an F that's inside the G category. 

So this diagram represents, according to your hypothesis,this diagram represents what the members of this foreign culture mean by Jid!. Okay, so now suppose you hear one of the members of this foreign culture give the following argument. 

Jid! Giraffes are herbivores, you translate it. 

Then they say Jid! Herbivores are mammals. 

And then they draw the conclusion there are some giraffes, and all of them are mammals. 

Now, is that argument valid? Well, let's use the Venn diagram for Jid! to figure out whether or not it's valid. 

So the first premise says, Jid! Giraffes are herbivores. 

So, how do we represent that? Well, remember, we have to shade out the portion of the Giraffes' circle that's outside the Herbivores' circle. And we have to draw an X that's in the Giraffes' circle and in the Herbivores' circle. We don't know quite where to draw that X, so let's hedge our bets right now and draw it over here, okay? 

The second premise though tells us that Jid herbivores are mammals. 

Now, how do we represent that? Well, remember by the Venn diagram, we have to shade out that part of the Herbivore circle that's outside the Mammal circle. 

And draw an X inside the Herbivore circle that's also inside the Mammal circle. 

Right, now we know this X we drew on the edge has to be inside the Mammal circle, not outside the Mammal circle, okay? So we're going to put this X right here on the edge of the Mammal circle and the Giraffe circle. because we don't know specifically which one it's supposed to go into. 

But wait, we do, and here's why we do. Remember, that when we drew the X on the border of the Mammals' circle and the Herbivores' circle right here, inside the Giraffes' circle. We weren't sure if that X was supposed to go in here or in here. Now we know that this X is supposed to go in here. 

So, maybe they're also Herbivore Mammals that are not Giraffes. But what we can definitely conclude from premises one and two, is that there are Herbivore Mammals that are Giraffes. So we know that there's an X that's supposed to go in this region right here. 

There's an X in that region right here and then this whole region is shaded out, there's nothing in this whole region. 

That's what we know from premises one and two using the Venn diagram for Jid, excuse me, for Jid! Okay, now, let's apply that to our argument. Well, what does our argument say? It says, there are some giraffes and all of them are mammals. But that's exactly what we can read off from the Venn diagram that we just constructed, right? If you look at the Venn diagram that we just constructed, there's an X that's inside the Giraffe circle and inside the Mammal circle. And every part of the Giraffe circle that's outside the Mammal circle is shaded out. 

So there aren't any giraffes that are not mammals. 

Okay, so we just figured out that this argument is valid. And we figured it out even though our only understanding of Jid, was from the Venn diagram that we constructed. 

Now, I have another question. 

Given this Venn diagram 

How would you translate Jid into English? 

Well, often people use the word all 

to mean the same thing that Jid means according to this Venn diagram. People speaking ordinary English use the word all to mean precisely this quantifier, right? When they use the word all they often mean. 

That there are things in the category that they're modifying by all. Like if I say, all ravens are birds, often what I'm understood to mean is there actually are some ravens. And all the ravens there are, are birds. So there are some things in the F circle, but they're all inside the G circle. There are some things in the circle of Ravens, let's say, but they're all also inside the circle of birds. There are no Ravens outside the Birds' circle, but there are Ravens inside the Birds' circle. That's often what people would understand me to mean if I said all ravens are birds. Now, we've been using the quantifier all. We've been understanding the quantifier all in a different way. So that it doesn't imply that there actually are members of the category that's being modified by all. So the way we've been using the quantifier all, if you say all ravens are birds, all you mean is there aren't any ravens that are not birds. 

But that's not the same as saying there are ravens, and all of them are birds. 

So it looks like we can use the Venn diagram for Jid! To translate that quantifier, in a foreign language into a familiar quantifier from ordinary English. 

### different ways of pressenting information

In unit two of this course in our study of the rules governing the validity of deductive arguments, we've looked at other ways of representing information, other ways besides sentences. We've looked at representing information using a truth table or using a Venn diagram. 

Now today in this final lecture of unit two, I'd like to talk about the advantages of these other ways of representing information. What's the point of using truth tables or using Venn diagrams? Why did we learn these techniques? 

That's the topic of today's lecture. Okay, so let's consider some different ways that we can represent the same information. 

Consider for example this list of seven sentences. Here's seven sentences. They all represent the very same information, they all mean the very same thing, they just say the same thing in different languages. One is in French, one is Italian, one is in Spanish and so on, but even though they're in different languages and they look different, they all express the same information. They represent the same information. 

Well similarly, just as we can use different sentences to represent that information, we can also use something that is not a sentence at all to represent that information. For instance, here we can use a truth table to represent the very same information that we were representing by means of those different sentences in the previous slide. So look at this truth table for a moment. Now, first [COUGH] column of the truth table is the proposition Walter likes bourbon, the second column of the truth table is the proposition Walter likes vodka, and the third column is the conjunction of those two propositions. Which could naturally be expressed in English by the sentence, Walter likes bourbon and vodka. And now what we can do, once we have this truth table here that shows how the truth or falsity of the conjunction depends on the truth or falsity of each of the conjuncts, we can circle a particular line of that truth table to indicate that this is the situation that we're actually in. Okay, now when we circle that particular row of the truth table, what we're doing is expressing the very same information that we expressed using one of these seven sentences earlier, right? There's no difference in what information we're expressing, what information we're representing. We're just representing it without using a sentence. We're representing it by circling a row of the truth table, okay? So it's just a different way of representing the same information. 

Now you might wonder, well, what's the point of representing that same information in different ways? Well, the point of representing the same information using different sentences in different languages is just that you can make yourself understood by different groups of people. You can say it in French to make yourself understood in France. You can say it in Spanish to make yourself understood in Spain or in Latin America. You can say it in Russian to make yourself understood in Russia, and so forth. So, what's the point of using the truth table, and there's no country where they speak truth table, so what's the point of using a truth table to express the very same information? Well, the point is that by using a truth table to represent the very same information, you represent that information in a way that makes very clear 

exactly what deductive arguments that use that information are valid and which ones are invalid. So for instance, by looking at this truth table, looking at our representation of the information that uses this truth table, we can see very clearly that the argument from the premise, Walter likes bourbon and vodka, to the conclusion, Walter likes bourbon, is going to be a valid argument. There's no possible way for the premise to be true while the conclusion is false, right? If the premise is true, then the conclusion is also going to have to be true. 

But we can also see that the deductive argument from the premise, Walter likes bourbon, to the conclusion, Walter likes bourbon and vodka, is invalid. There is a possible way for the premise, Walter likes bourbon, to be true while the conclusion, Walter likes bourbon and vodka, is false. So by looking at the truth table, you can see very plainly why some deductive arguments that involve the proposition, Walter likes bourbon and vodka, are valid. And other deductive arguments involving that same proposition are invalid. And that's something that you can't see just as clearly by looking at any of the seven sentences that we can use to represent that information. 

So these sentences have some advantages as a way of representing the information that they all represent. 

But they all have a disadvantage relative to the truth table, which shows us plainly why certain arguments that use that information are valid and others are invalid. 

So that's the advantage of using a truth table to represent information that could be represented more naturally by means of sentences. It's not that we make ourselves understood by more people when we use a truth table. It's rather that when we use a truth table, we can see relations of deductive validity that we can't just see when we use sentences. Okay, now how about Venn diagrams? Well, consider again a piece of information that could be represented using any of these seven sentences, right? One is in French, one is in Spanish, one is in Italian, and so on. All seven of these sentences mean the same thing. They express the very same information. 

And they represent it, even though they represent the same information, they're useful in different situations. You might use one when you're in Russia, and you want to be understood by Russians. You might use another when you're in India, and you want to be understood by a certain population of people in India. You might want to use another when you're in Brazil or Portugal, and you want to be understood by Portuguese speakers. 

But notice, none of these sentences represent the information that they represent in a way that makes it completely clear which deductive arguments that use that information are valid and which are invalid. Okay, we can make that point clear by representing the same information using a Venn diagram. First, we construct a circle to represent the category of Walter's drinks. And second, we construct a circle to represent the category of imported things. 

And since these seven sentences all say that all of Walter's drinks are imported, we can then shade out the part of the circle representing Walter's drinks that's outside the circle of imported things. To show us that if Walter drinks anything, then whatever it is that he drinks must be imported, it must be inside this region here. Okay, and now we have a Venn diagram that represents the very same information that was represented by those seven sentences. But what's the point of representing this information using a Venn diagram? Well the Venn diagram shows us which deductive arguments that use that information are valid and which are invalid. So for instance, consider the argument from all Walter's drinks are imported to all imported drinks are Walter's. Is that argument valid or invalid? Well, if you just look at the sentences, it might not be obvious whether it's valid or invalid, but if you look at the Venn diagram, you can see quite clearly that this argument is invalid. 

For all of Walter's drinks to be imported is for this part of the Venn diagram to be shaded in. But for all imported drinks to be Walter's would be for this part of the Venn diagram to be shaded in. And the question is, is there some way for the premise to be true while the conclusion is false? And the answer is clearly, yes. This part of the Venn diagram could be shaded in, even if this part of the Venn diagram is not shaded in. 

And so, this is an example of how we can use the Venn diagram to show very plainly and visually why certain arguments that use the information, all Walter's drinks are imported. Certain of those arguments are valid and certain of them are invalid. 

Again, so the point of using the Venn diagram to represent information is in that respect very similar to the point of using a truth table to represent information. When you want to understand whether a particular deductive argument is valid or invalid, sometimes it helps to translate the information in that argument into a form where you can plainly see the relations of validity or invalidity, into a form like a truth table or a Venn diagram. Where you can plainly see those relationships because ordinary language doesn't always expose those relationships. Okay, so that's why truth tables and Venn diagrams are useful devices for understanding whether deductive arguments are valid or invalid. And there are many other useful devices like that, but truth tables and Venn diagrams are the two simplest ones, and so the two that we focused on in this course. Okay, well, have fun with the quizzes and have fun with the rest of the course. See you next time.
