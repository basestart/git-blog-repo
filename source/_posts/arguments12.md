# How to Untangle an Argument

CONTENT: This week’s material will focus on the special language in which arguments are formulated. We will investigate the functions of particular words, including premise and conclusion markers plus assuring, guarding, discounting, and evaluative terms. Identifying these words will enable students to separate arguments from the irrelevant verbiage that surrounds it and then to break the argument into parts and to identify what each part of an argument is doing. The lectures end with a detailed example that uses these tools to closely analyze an op-ed from a newspaper.

LEARNING OUTCOMES: By the end of this week’s material, you will be able to:

understand three levels of meaning
identify argument markers

## How to Identify an Argument

### argumnet markers

Welcome to week two. In week one, we talked about language in general. 

This week, we want to talk about how language is used in one particular context, namely, the context of arguments. 

We need to understand the language of argument in order to be able to spot an argument, that is to determine when a passage contains an argument and what part of the passage is that argument. So, how can we tell when an argument is being given? Well, recall the definition of argument as a series of sentences, statements, or propositions, where some of there premises, and one of them's a conclusion, and the premises are intended to give a reason for the conclusion. So the real question of when an argument is being given comes down to the question of when certain sentences are intended as reasons for other sentences. Now the answer is that, we can tell a person's intentions when they're speaking by which words they choose. So there are going to be certain words that indicate that some sentences are reasons for others. Just compare these two sentences. I am tall and I good at sports. 

And compare that to; I am tall, so I am good at sports. Now notice that you can take the first sentence, I am tall and I am good at a sports, and switch it around, I am good at sports and I am tall. Switching doesn't make any difference. But it's very different if you say, I am tall, so I am good at sports. That's very different from, I'm good at sports, so I am tall. So we know from the fact that you can switch around the and sentence and you cannot switch around the so sentence. The word so introduces something very different from just conjoining the two claims. But then, what's the difference? 

Well, the difference is that when you use the word and, you're simply stating the two facts. I am tall. I am good at sports. And the is they're both true. But when you use the word so, you're indicating that one of them is a reason for the other. If you say, I am tall, so I am good at sports, then you're suggesting that the reason why you're good at sports is that you're tall. But if you say, I'm good at sports, so I am tall. You're indicating that the fact that you're good at sports is some kind of evidence that you must be tall. Maybe because you can only be good at sports of you're tall, which isn't true. That just shows it's a bad argument. But it is an argument, because by using the word so, you're indicating that one of the sentences is the reason for the other. Of course the word so is not the only word that plays this role in arguments or has this function. You can also say, I am tall. Therefore, I am good at sports. I am tall. Thus, I am good at sports. Or I am tall. Hence, I am good at sports. Or I am tall. Accordingly, I am good at sports. 

All of these different pairs of sentences play the same role. They indicate that there's an argument there, namely, the fact that I am tall is a reason for the conclusion that I am good at sports. So, we're going to call all these words argument markers, because they mark or indicate the presence of an argument. Next, we want to distinguish two different kinds of argument markers. So far, we've looked at so, and therefore, and thus, and accordingly. Each of those indicates that the sentence right after that is a conclusion, and the other sentence in the pair is a premise. So, we're going to call these conclusion markers because they indicate that the sentence right after them is a conclusion. But the other argument markers that also indicate arguments in the same way. What they indicate is that the sentence after them is a reason, or a premise, not a conclusion. For example, I could say, I'm good at sports because I am tall. Now the word because indicates that the fact I'm tall is a reason for the conclusion that I'm good at sports. It doesn't mean that the sentence after the word because is a conclusion. Instead, it means that the sentence after the word because is a reason, or a premise. So, we're going to call it a reason marker, or a premise marker. And there are other reason markers as well. You could say, I am good at sports for I am tall. I am good at sports, as I am tall. I am good at sports, for the reason that I am tall. I'm good at sports and the reason why is that I am tall. 

All of these words, both the conclusion markers and the reason markers, indicate that there's an argument present, but only in some cases. You can't just look at the word and figure out whether it's an argument marker or not. You have to think about the role that it's playing. A perfect example of that is another reason marker, since. You can say, I'm good at sports since I am tall. And then it looks like you're presenting the fact that you're tall as a reason why you're good at sports. But the word since doesn't always play that role. After all, you can say, the sun has been up since 7 o'clock this morning. And that doesn't mean that somehow the sun has an alarm clock that causes it to come right up at 7 o'clock. All it's saying is that the sun has been up after the time of 7 o'clock and all times since then. It doesn't indicate any kind of rational relation. Such as, the fact that at 7 o'clock being the reason why the sun came up. Or what about this one? It's been raining since my vacation began. Very disappointing, but you're not saying that it's raining because your vacation began as if there's some kind of plot against you and the nature or weather. That would be very paranoid. All you're saying is that, it has been raining everyday since the time when your vacation began, or everyday after your vacation began. So the since there, indicates just a temporal relation, not some kind of rational relation. 

And what this shows us is that you can't just look for the word since and always mark it as an argument marker. You have to think about what the word since is doing in that context, and that'll be true for a lot of other reason markers and conclusion markers as well. Here's another example the same point, but with a conclusion marker, the word so. The word so sometimes indicates that, the sentence after it is a conclusion and the sentence before it's a reason. But it can also indicate something entirely different. You don't need to eat so much. 

So there doesn't indicate that much is a reason for anything. 

The word so is getting used in an entirely different way. That should be obvious. But the point again, is that you can't just look for the word so and label it as an argument marker. You have to think about the function that it's playing in the particular context. But then how can we tell what role a word is playing in a particular context. Here's a little trick. Try substituting another word that's clearly an argument marker. That is, it's clearly a reason marker or a conclusion marker. For the original word that you weren't so sure about. 

Here's an example. He's so cool! 

Does that mean he's because cool? No, if you substitute because for so the meaning changes entirely. 

Not even clear what it means. Or how about, he's therefore cool. That don't make much sense either. So in this case you can't substitute another argument marker because or therefore for the original word so without changing the meaning of the sentence entirely. And that shows you that, in the original sentence, the word so was not being used, as an argument marker. Either a reason marker or conclusion marker. 

Here's another example. Well, since he left college, he's been unemployed. 

Well are you saying that, because he left college he's unemployed? Maybe, if that's what you're saying then you can substitute the word because without changing the meaning of the sentence. And then the word since was being used as a reason marker in that case. But probably not. Probably, the claim is simply that since the time when he left college, he's been unemployed. 

And then if that's what you mean, then when you substitute because for since, it changes the meaning. 

And that would show that in that context the word is not playing the role of an argument marker, or a reason marker. Because it changes the meaning to substitute something like because that's clearly an argument marker. 

On the other hand, you might have a similar claim where you can substitute it. 

Since he failed out of college, he's unemployed. 

Whoa! Now, if somebody says that, they don't just mean since the time when he failed out of college he's unemployed. Probably the meaning is not changed if you simply said because he failed out of college, he's unemployed. 

So, since you can substitute because for since in that sentence, in that sentence the word since is probably being used as an argument marker. That's the role it's playing. That's it's function. That's how it's being used. 

And notice also, that you can tell that the word since in that sentence is a reason marker instead of a conclusion marker. Because you can substitute because, and you cannot substitute therefore. 

Therefore he failed out of college, he's been unemployed. That doesn't make a lot of sense. 

So, if you can substitute because without changing the meaning, then the original word, since in this case, was being used as a reason marker. 

You cannot substitute the word therefore. That shows it's not being used as a conclusion marker. 

So you can use this substitution test to determine whether the word is being used as a reason marker or as a conclusion marker, or as no indicator whatsoever of an argument but in some entirely different way. 

One last word that we have to talk about is that little word if. Sometimes it's linked with the word then, in an if-then clause, which is also called a conditional. And we'll talk a lot about conditionals later in this course. But for now, I just want to make one point. 

The word if might seem like an argument marker, because it's often used in arguments. For example; I might say, If I'm rich enough, I can buy a baseball team. 

I am rich enough, so I can buy a baseball team. That would be an argument. But if all I say is If I'm rich enough, I can buy a baseball team, when I know I'm not rich enough. So, I would never assert the if clause that says I am rich enough. Then, that little if sentence is not being used to indicate an argument at all. Its just saying, if If I am rich enough, then I can buy a baseball team. It's not saying that I am rich enough, and it's not saying that I can buy a baseball team. So, the word if by itself does not indicate an argument. It sets a pattern for argument, if one thing then another. Well, the one thing, therefore, the other. But the IF (one thing) THEN (another) doesn't by itself indicate any argument at all because it doesn't assert that IF clause which is also called the antecedent of the conditional. So we are not going to count the word if as an argument marker. Now we've learned how to identify an argument. It's simple, huh? But just to make sure you've got it straight, let's do a few exercises. 


Welcome to week two. 欢迎来到第二周 In week one, we talked about language in general. 在第一周 我们总体地讨论了语言 

这一周 我们将要讨论语言在 used in one particular context, namely, the context of arguments.某一特定语境下的使用 即是论证环境 

We need to understand the language of argument in order to be able to spot我们需要理解论证 的语言来辨认 an argument, that is to determine when a passage contains an argument and what part一个论证 也就是说去确定一篇文章中 什么时候有论证 文章中 of the passage is that argument.哪一部分是这个论证 So, how can we tell when an argument is being given? 所以，我们什么时候可以确定文中出现论证？  嗯 回忆一下论证的定义 “一系列的 of sentences, statements, or propositions, where some of there句子、陈述、或者命题 其中有些 这个定义有标准的翻译还是以标准为主 前提 还有一个结论 前提旨在揭示结论的原因 所以什么时候一个论证出现的问题 实质上就是 什么时候有些句子旨在 揭示别的句子的原因的问题 Now the answer is that, we can tell a所以答案就是 我们可以 person's intentions when they're speaking by which words they choose.从一个人说话选择的词 来感知他的意图 So there are going to be certain words that所以有一些特定的词汇 indicate that some sentences are reasons for others.标志着有一些句子是另外一些句子的原因 先比较这两个句子 “我长得高和我擅长运动” 

And compare that to; I am tall, so I am good at sports.把它和“我很高 因此我很擅长运动”作比较 Now notice that you can take the first sentence, I am tall and I am good注意到 你可以把第一个句子 “我长得高和我擅长运动” at a sports, and switch it around, I am good at sports and I am tall.中的成分调换一下位置 “我擅长运动和我长得高” 调换并没有导致任何不同 但是（对另外一个句子）就会有很大改变 如果你说“我长得高 所以我擅长运动” That's very different from, I'm good at sports,这和“我擅长运动 所以我长得高” so I am tall.截然不同 所以从这些事实 我们知道了我们可以 对有“和”的句子调换句子成分 但是不可以对有“所以”的句子这么做 The word so introduces something very“所以”这个词的作用并不仅仅是 introduce求更好的翻译 different from just conjoining the two claims.联结句子两个成分这么简单 但是，它的不同又是什么呢？ 

Well, the difference is that when you use嗯 不同就在于当你用 the word and, you're simply stating the two facts.“和”这个词的时候 你只是简单的点明两个事实 我长得高“ “我擅长运动” And the is they're both true.这里他们都是真实的 the is????? But when you use the word so, you're indicating但是当你用“所以”这个词的时候 就表明 that one of them is a reason for the other.一个事实是另一个的原因 如果你说 “我长得高 所以我擅运动” 那么 那么你就是暗示 你擅长运动的原因是你很高 但是如果你说 “我擅长运动 所以我长得高” You're indicating that the fact that you're good at sports 你就是在表明你 很擅长运动的事实 is some kind of evidence that you must be tall.是你长得确实很高的某种证据 Maybe because you can only be good at sports of you're tall, which isn't true.可能你只有你长得高你才能擅长运动 That just shows it's a bad argument.这就是一个不好的论证 但是这仍然是一个论证 因为它用了“所以”这个词 indicating that one of the sentences is the reason for the other.表示一个句子是另一个句子的原因 Of course the word so is not the only word当然“所以”这个词不是唯一的 that plays this role in arguments or has this function.在论证中起作用或者有这个功能的词 你也可以说“我长得高 因此我擅长运动” “我长得高 从而 I am good at sports. Or I am tall.我擅长运动” 或者“我长得高 因而我擅长运动” 或者“我长得高 Accordingly, I am good at sports.于是我很擅长运动” 

All of these different pairs of sentences play the same role.这些所有的成对的句子 都起同样的作用 它们表明这里有论证 也就是 我很高的事实 是我很擅长运动 这个结论的原因 所以 我们称这些词为论证标记 因为它们标记了 或者 表明了论证的存在 Next, we want to distinguish two different kinds of argument markers.接下来 我们要辨别 两种不同的论证标记 So far, we've looked at so, and therefore, and thus, and accordingly.到目前为止 我们接触到了“所以” “因此”“因而”和“于是” Each of those indicates that the sentence right after that is a conclusion, and这些词里的每一个都表明 它们之后的句子是一个结论 另一个句子则是一个前提 所以我们称这些为结论标记 因为他们 表明了他们之后的句子是一个结论 But the other argument markers that also indicate arguments in the same way.但是还有另外一组论证标记 也可以以同样的方式表明论证 它们表明的是 它们之后的句子 is a reason, or a premise, not a conclusion.是一个原因 或者一个前提 但不是一个结论 For example, I could say, I'm good at sports because I am tall. 举个例子 我可以说 我擅长体育因为我长得高 这里这个“因为”就表明 I'm tall is a reason for the conclusion that I'm good at sports.我长得高这个事实是 我擅长体育这个结论的一个原因 它并不表示“因为”这个词 后面的句子是一个结论 Instead, it means that the sentence after the而是表示 在它之后的句子 是一个原因 或者前提 So, we're going to call it a reason marker, or a premise marker.所以 我们把它称为原因标记 或者前提标记 此外还有其他的 原因标记 你可以说 “我擅长体育 因为（for）我长的高” “我擅长体育 其原因是我长得高” “我擅长体育 为什么呢？是我长得高” 

所有的这些词 包括结论标记和原因标记 indicate that there's an argument present, but only in some cases. 表明了论证的存在 但是在某些情况下 You can't just look at the word and 你不能仅仅靠看这些词 就认定这是一个论证或者不是 You have to think about the role that it's playing.你应该考虑它所起的作用 A perfect example of that is another reason marker, since.一个非常好的例子是 另外一个原因标记 “since”（since在英文中既有‘因为’的意思也有‘从...时候起’的意思） since粗线了= = 我还是把它翻译为因为 求大神指教 You can say, I'm good at sports since你可以说 “我擅长体育since（因为）我长得高” 我长得高“ 这样你就是表示 你长得高的事实 是你擅长运动的原因 But the word since doesn't always play that role.但是‘since’这个词不经常起这个作用 毕竟 你可以说 “太阳从since（从）早晨7点钟就已经升起了” 这并不表示 太阳公公有某种闹钟 在7点钟的时候 准时把它在叫醒 All it's saying is that the sun has been up这个句子想表示的就是 太阳在 早上7点钟的时候就已经升起了 并且之后的时间都是升起的 It doesn't indicate any kind of rational relation.它并不表示任何一种因果关系 rational....逻辑？ 因果？ 我觉得在这里因果关系比较妥一点。。 比如说 7点钟的事实是 太阳升起的原因 Or what about this one?看看这个句子？ It's been raining since my vacation began.“since我的假期开始 天就一直下雨” 非常悲剧 但是它的意思并不是 that it's raining because your vacation began天在下雨因为（since）你的假期开始了 as if there's some kind of plot against you and the nature or weather.就像是有什么阴谋针对你和天气一样 这是偏执狂的想法！ 这句话的意思是说 从你假期开始的 那个时间点开始 everyday since the time when your 每天每天都下雨 vacation began, or everyday after your vacation began.或者你假期开始后的每一天都下雨 （感觉这几句话比较重复） So the since there, indicates just a 所以这里表明的是 一个时间上的关系 不是什么因果关系 

这个例子让我们知道的是 不能只凭 for the word since and always mark it as an argument marker.看到了since这个词 就自动把它脑补为论证标记 You have to think about what the word since is doing in that context, and你应该考虑这个词 在上下文之间的作用 这个同样适用于很多其他 原因标记和结论标记 Here's another example the same point, but with a conclusion marker, the word so这里是另一个差不多的例子 不过这次是结论标记 “so”这个词（so在英文中既有‘所以’的意思也有‘非常’的意思） The word so sometimes indicates that, the sentence after it so(所以)这个词有时候表明 它之后的句子 is a conclusion and the sentence before it's a reason.是一个结论 而它之前的句子 是一个原因 但它也可以表示 完全不同的意思 You don't need to eat so much. “你不需要吃so（这么）多” 

这里的"so"并不表明 “多”是任何事实的原因 

"so"这个词有完全不同的用法 That should be obvious.这是极其明显的 与此同理 你不可以单单凭看一眼这个词 就判定它是个 论证标记 You have to think about the function that it's playing in the particular context.你应该考虑这个词 在特定语境中起的作用 But then how can we tell what role a word is playing in a particular context.但是我们怎么判定一个词 在特定语境中起什么作用呢？ 这里有一个小技巧 Try substituting another word that's clearly an argument marker.尝试着把这个词换成另外一个 确定是论证标记的词 That is, it's clearly a reason marker or a conclusion marker.就是说 这个词确定是一个原因标记或者 一个结论标记 For the original word that you weren't so sure about.对于你不太确定的那个 原先的词 

Here's an example. He's so cool!这就是一个例子 “他so（非常）酷” 

Does that mean he's because cool? No,这是“他是因为酷”的意思吗？ 不 if you substitute because for so the meaning changes entirely.如果你把so（所以）换成因为 整个意思就改变了 这里是不是有点问题 so是conclution marker 怎么能用because这个reason marker 来换呢? 口误吗？= = 

Not even clear what it means. Or how about, he's therefore cool. 它的意思就非常不清楚 或者让我们想想“他因此酷” 还是用的reason marker来换的so.... 这也不知所云 So in this case you can't所以在这种情况下你不能 在不改变句意的情况下 for the original word so without changing the meaning of the sentence entirely.把原本的so换成 因为 或者因此 And that shows you that,这就表示 in the original sentence, the word so was not being used, as an argument marker.在原来的句子里 so这个词 并不是作为论证标记来用的 它既不是一个原因标记 也不是结论 标记 

来看另一个例子下面再举另一个例子 嗯 since他大学辍学 他一直 待业（since在英文中 既有从...时候开始 也有 因为 的意思） 

Well are you saying that, because he left college he's unemployed? 嗯 这句话的意思是 因为他大学辍学了 他就待业？ 你可能现在就想了 这句话可以把 since换成因为 而不改变句子 of the sentence.的原意 所以since这个词在这个情况下 被用作一个论证标记 但也有可能不是 可能 这句话的意思 仅仅是 从他从大学辍学之后，他就一直 待业 

如果这是这句话的意思的话 那么当你 you substitute because for since, it changes the meaning.把since（从...开始）换成因为的时候 句子就变了意思 

And that would show that 这就表示 in that context the word is not playing the在这个语境下这个词并不起 论证标记 或者原因标记的作用 Because it changes the meaning to substitute因为当把它换成 something like because that's clearly an argument marker.像“因为”这样确定是论证标记的词的时候 句子就改变了意思 

在另一个方面 你可能有 类似想法 认为你可以把它替换掉 

"since他大学辍学 他一直待业" 

Whoa!多么神奇的句子！ 现在 如果有人说 它们并不仅仅是 从他大学辍学 他就一直待业 的意思 如果你就说 因为他大学辍学 他一直待业 可能它的意思也差不多 

So, since you can substitute because for since in that sentence, in所以 因为你可以把这句话里的 since换成因为 在这个句子里since这个词 可能就是作为一个论证标记在用 That's the role it's playing.这就是它的作用 这就是它的功能 That's how it's being used.这就是它的用法 感觉这三个词又重复了= = 

并且也要注意 你可以说 since这个词 在这个句子里是一个原因标记 而不是一个结论标记 Because you can substitute because, and you cannot substitute therefore.因为你可以你可以用“因为”来替换它 但不可以用“因此”来替换 

“因此他从大学辍学 他就一直待业” That doesn't make a lot of sense.这根本听不懂 

So, if you can substitute because without changing the meaning, then所以 如果你可以在不改变句子原意的情况下 用“因为”来替换 原本的词 - 在这里是since - 这个词就是作为原因标记在用 

You cannot substitute the word therefore.你不能用“因此”来替换这个词 That shows it's not being used as a conclusion marker.这就表明 它不作为 一个结论标记在用 

So you can use this substitution test to determine所以你可以用这个替换测验 来确定 这个词到底是作为一个原因标记 or as a conclusion marker, or as no indicator还是一个结论标记 这仍然是一个论证但是是一个 完全不同的论证 

我们要讨论的最后一个词 是简短的if（if在英文中意为 因为 或 如果） Sometimes it's linked with the word then, in an if-then clause, which is also有时候它会和“那么”连在一起用 在“如果..那么..”这个子句里 这个子句也被叫做条件句 And we'll talk a lot about conditionals later in this course.在接下来的课程中 我们将会讨论很多 关于条件句东西 But for now, I just want to make one point.但是现在 我只想点明 一点 

if 这个词可能看起来像 argument marker, because it's often used in arguments.一个论证标记 因为它经常用在 论证中 For example; I might say, If I'm rich enough, I can buy a baseball team.举个例子 我就说“如果我足够富有 我可以买一个棒球队” 

“我足够富有 所以我可以买一个 棒球队” That would be 这就是 一个论证 但是如果我说的是“如果我足够富有 can buy a baseball team, when I know I'm not rich enough.我可以买一个棒球队” 当然我知道我 并没有那么富有 So, I would never assert the if clause that says I am rich enough.所以 我不会坚持我条件句中 “我足够富有”的主张 然后 这一小段if开头的句子 一点儿也不表示是一个论证 Its just saying, if If I am rich enough, then I can buy a baseball team.它只是说“如果我足够富有 那么我可以买一个棒球队” It's not saying that I am rich enough, and并不是说 我足够富有 也不是说我可以买一个棒球队 So, the word if by itself does not indicate an argument.所以 if这个词单独出现 并不表示论证 它建立了一种论证的模式 如果 某事发生 那么另一事就接着发生 Well, the one thing, therefore, the other. But the IF (one thing) THEN (another)嗯 一件事 所以另一件事 但是 如果（一件事）那么（另一件事） 本身一点儿也不表示论证 因为由if这个词开头的 if也被叫做条件句的先行词 这一句和前面一句连不起来 还要再想一想 So we are not going to count the word if as an argument marker. 所以我们并不把if这个词 算作论证标记 现在我们学习了 怎么去辨别一个 论证 非常简单 是吧？ But just to make sure you've got it straight, let's do a few exercises.但是为了确定你已经完全 理解了 让我们来做一些练习 

### stardard form

Now that we've identified arguments, and we've also identified premises and conclusions, we need to put them in order. The actual word order doesn't always tell us the order of argument. Compare these two sentences: because I am a professor, I teach classes, I teach classes, because I am a professor. In those two examples, the words, I am a professor, in one instance, occur at the beginning, and the other instance occur at the end. But they actually express exactly the same argument, namely, the fact that I'm a professor, is a reason why I teach classes. But contrast both of those with this example. 

I teach classes so I must be a professor. The point there must be something like, nobody but professors can teach classes, and whether nor not that's true, point here is, that's a different argument from the first one. And we need to represent the difference between these two arguments very carefully. In order to show what is shared by the first two examples that's different from the third example, we put the arguments in what's called standard form. And it's really easy. 

Basically, you put the premise down, and if there's another premise you put that down. Then you draw a line. 

Then you put what I call a dot pyramid, it's basically three little dots with two at the bottom and one at the top, and then you put the conclusion after that. It's also useful; we'll see why later. But it's useful to number the premises, and to number the conclusion, so that we can refer back to the premise and conclusion with the number, instead of having to repeat it all the time. And that's all there is to standard form. You just put down the premises on different lines. Then you draw a line, put the little dot pyramid, and then write down the conclusion, and then number them all. 

That's it. 

And this standard form accomplishes what we wanted it to. Namely, it helps us show what's common to the first two examples at the beginning of this lecture, that distinguishes them from the third example. So the first two examples were, I teach classes because I'm a professor, and because I'm a professor I teach classes. There the sentence, the premise that goes above the line is, I am a professor, and the conclusion that goes below the line and next to the dot pyramid is, I teach classes. 

But the next example, the third example at the beginning of the lecture was, I teach classes, 

so I must be a professor. Now that means that, I am a professor, is the conclusion that goes below the line, next to the dot pyramid, and the premise is, I teach classes. So when you put these two in standard form, right next to each other, it makes it absolutely clear what the difference is. And what's in common to the first two that distinguishes them from the third one. 

No matter how easy, I think it's still worthwhile to do a few exercises just to make sure we've got it straight, because this notion of standard form will become important later. 


现在我们学习了论证 也学习了 premises and conclusions, we need to put them in order. 学习了前提和结论 我们要把它们排好顺序 The actual word order doesn't always tell us the order of argument. 光是这些词不会告诉我们它的顺序 比较下这个句子 因为我是个教授 teach classes, I teach classes, because I am a professor. 我给学生上课 我上课因为我是教授 In those two examples, the words, I am a professor, 在这两句话中 “我是教授” in one instance, occur at the beginning, and the other instance occur at the end. 在第一个例子中 被放在了前面 而第二个例子中在后面 实际上这两个是完全一样的 都表示了 that I'm a professor, is a reason why I teach classes. 我是教授 这是为什么我上课的原因的意思 But contrast both of those with this example. 但再来比较这两个 

我给学生上课 因此我肯定是个教授 其中的逻辑是 like, nobody but professors can teach classes, and whether nor not that's 只有教授可以教课 true, point here is, that's a different argument from the first one. 先不管它是不是对的 这句话与之前的是完全不同的 And we need to represent the 我们来好好的看下 这两个句子的不同之处 为了展现前两个句子的相似 以及它们和第三个句子的不同 from the third example, we put the arguments in what's called standard form. 我们来把它们都整成标准形式 这很容易 

Basically, you put the premise down, and 基本上 你写一个前提 如果还有前提 你也把它放在下面 Then you draw a line. 然后你再画条线 

然后你再加个“点金字塔” 基本上就是两个点在底下 at the bottom and one at the top, and then you put the conclusion after that. 一个在上面 然后再把结论写下面 It's also useful; we'll see why later. 我们以后就知道为什么这种方式 But it's useful 很有用了 to number the premises, and to number the conclusion, so that we can refer back to 为了更方便 我们把前提和结论都标上号 the premise and conclusion with the number, instead 就不用再 of having to repeat it all the time. 把它们都重复一遍了 这就是标准格式 You just put down the premises on different lines. 你只要把前提放在一条线上 再画条线 放个点金字塔 然后写下结论 并把它们都标上号 

仅此而已 【教育无边界字幕组】翻译：拖延菌 | 校对：鸭肉松 | 审阅：|就这样 

And this standard form accomplishes what we wanted it to. 而这个标准格式帮助我们分析 Namely, it helps us show what's common to the first two examples 基本上 它告诉我们了前两个句子的共同点 并且告诉我们它们俩和第三个句子的不同 So the first two examples were, I teach classes because 在前两个例子里 我教课因为 I'm a professor, and because I'm a professor I teach classes. 我是教授 因为我是教授 所以我授课 There the sentence, the premise that goes above the line is, 这样的话 上面的句子是 我是教授 而结论是横线下面的那句 line and next to the dot pyramid is, I teach classes. 我授课 

But the next example, the third example at 但在后面那个例子中 the beginning of the lecture was, I teach classes, 前提是我授课 

所以我肯定是个教授 Now that means that, I am a professor, is the conclusion that goes 这意味着 我是教授是那个结论 而前提是“我教课” So when you put these two in standard form, right next 所以你把这些句子放入标准形式中 摆在一起 to each other, it makes it absolutely clear what the difference is. 你就知道区别在哪里了 And what's in common to the first two that distinguishes them from 很容易就看出前两个和第三个的区别 第三个的区别 

No matter how easy, I think it's still worthwhile to do a few exercises just to 尽管很容易 还是要多做练习 make sure we've got it straight, because this 保证我们能搞明白 之后标准格式会变得更加重要 


## Stopping the Regress

### a problem for arguments

Now we've learned how to identify an argument and put it in standard form, and we've also learned from the definition of argument that the premises are intended to be reasons for the conclusion. 

Great. Intended to be a reason for the conclusion. Well, intentions are nice, but success is better. What we need to figure out is when the person succeeds in giving premises that really are reasons for the conclusion. For simplicity, let's focus on arguments whose purpose is justification. 

Then the question is, do the premises justify you in believing the conclusion? Well, imagine that you don't know whether there's any life on Mars. You have no evidence, one way or the other. Then you ask a friend, and the friend says, hah, I know there's life on Mars. I can prove it to you. Here, this argument will show you that there's life on Mars. 

There is at least one bacterium on Mars. Therefore there is life on Mars. Now, notice that if the premise is true, the conclusion has gotta be true. And if you and your friend are justified in believing the premise, then you and your friend are also justified in believing the conclusion. So, this argument looks pretty good so far. 

But of course, you have to ask your friend, well, how do you know that there's at least one bacterium on Mars? And suppose your friend says, well, I, I'm just guessing. Then, the argument is clearly no good. If there's no reason to believe the premise because your friend is just guessing, then you're not justified in believing that premise, and if you're not justified in believing the premise, then how can that premise make you justified in believing the conclusion? 

More generally, an argument cannot justify you in believing the conclusion unless you're justified in accepting the premises of that argument. 

Now, suppose your friend says, but I do have a reason for the premise, I do! Then, we have to ask, what kind of reason is it? And, at that point, your friend needs to express that reason, and how do we express reasons? In arguments. So your friend needs to give another argument for the premise, where the premise of the first argument is the conclusion of the second argument. But wait a minute, now we've got a problem. Because that second argument is itself going to have premises, and you have to be justified in believing those. So, the premises of the second argument have to be the conclusion of a third argument, and so on and so on. Because the third argument needs premises, they have to be justified, so they have to be the conclusion of another argument, which also has to have premises, and those have to be the conclusion of another argument, and so on and so on. It looked like we've got a real problem here. 

In order for the premises to be justified, they have to be backed up by an argument, but the argument has premises of its own that have to be backed up by another argument, and so on and so on. This problem is called The Problem of the Skeptical Regress, because you regress back to one argument after another, after another, after another, after another, after another, after another. And it's hard to see how that regress is ever going to come to an end. There seem to be only three ways to get around the skeptical regress. The first is to start with a premise that's unjustified. If it's unjustified, then it doesn't need an argument to back it up, and that means that you're not going to have this chain of arguments going back and back and back and back and back and back and back. The second possibility is to have a structure where the arguments move in a circle. 

One claim is justified by another, which is justified by another, which is justified by another, which is justified by the first claim, and they just move in a circle. The third possibility is that the chain of arguments goes back infinitely. It never stops. Every claim has an argument to back it up. And there's no end, so you never have a premise which doesn't have an argument to back it up, because it's infinite. 

Those seem to be the three main options here to avoid the skeptical regress. The first possibility then, is to start with a premise that's unjustified. And that seems pretty neat, if you can get away with it. But we already saw why that won't work. We saw your friend arguing that there's life on Mars because there's at least one bacterium on Mars, and he was just guessing. If you just guess at your premises, you have no reason to believe them. Then, an argument that uses those premises cannot justify you in believing the conclusion. But in addition, just think about it this way, you could prove anything if we let you start with unjustified premises. If you can just make up your premises for no reason, then there's no stopping you from believing whatever, including things that are obviously false. So it seems to be a real problem to start with premises that are unjustified. Next, the second way to respond to the skeptical regress is to use a circular structure, and it's kind of neat, if you think about it. Because, if you want to prove one claim, you prove it on the basis of another claim. And then you prove that second claim on the basis of a third. And that third on the basis of fourth. And the fourth on the basis of a fifth. And the fifth on the basis of the first. And now you've got this circle. And the arguments go in a circle, but that means that every premise has an argument to back it up, because you can keep going around the circle forever. 

And if you think about it a little bit, it'll be obvious that that's no good, and that can be shown by looking at the smallest circle there is. 

So, suppose your friend says, I can prove there's life on Mars, here's my argument. There is life on Mars. Therefore, there is life on Mars. Clearly that's no good. And the reason why it's no good is that if you didn't know whether there was life on Mars to begin with, you wouldn't know whether the premise was true. because if you don't know the conclusion, you can't know the premise since the premise is the conclusion. 

So if you're not justified in believing the conclusion to begin with, you're not justified in believing the premise, and that means that the argument didn't really get you anywhere. It just ends up where it started. And in addition, it has the same problem we saw in the first approach, involving unjustified premises. Because you can use circular arguments to prove anything. You can prove there's life on Mars. There's life on Mars, therefore there's life on Mars. You can prove there's 

no life on Mars. There's no life on Mars, therefore there's no life on Mars. You can do it either way. And the fact that an argument can be used either way to prove either conclusion suggests there's a big problem with that kind of argument. So now we're down to the third and final way to get around the skeptical regress, and that's to use an infinite chain of arguments. But if you think about it in a concrete case, you'll see why that's a problem as well. 

Suppose your friend says, there's life on Mars and I can prove it. And you say fine, give me a reason. 

Well, there's at least one bacterium on Mars, therefore, there's life on Mars. And you go, okay, fine, but how do you know there's at least one bacterium on Mars? I've got another argument, he says. 

There are at least two bacteria on Mars. Therefore, there's at least one bacterium on Mars. But how do you know there's at least two? Well, there are at least three bacteria on Mars, therefore there are at least two bacteria on Mars. But how do you know there are at least three? Well, there are at least four, so there are at least three. Well, there are at least five, so there are at least four. Well, there are at least six, so there are at least five, and so on, and so on, and so on. You could go on infinitely. So, an infinite chain of arguments would allow you to prove that there's life on Mars, even if you have no evidence whatsoever of any bacteria. Because you're going to have an argument, but if the premise that you're arguing from doesn't have an independent justification, then the infinite chain is going to be no good at all in justifying the conclusion of that argument. So many people see the skeptical regress as a deep and serious philosophical issue. If the unjustified premise approach doesn't work, and the circular argument structure doesn't work, and the infinite chain of arguments doesn't work, then it's hard to see how we can get around the problem, which is to say it's hard to see how any kind of argument could ever justify us in believing anything. Philosophers really scratched their heads about that for a long time and worry about it. It keeps them up at night. 

But, we're going to have to look at how practical people solve a similar problem in everyday life. So how do we solve the skeptical regress problem in everyday life? Well, there are various tricks that you can use. For example, one way is to just start from assumptions that everybody shares. So, 

if I say, well you really ought to buy a Honda, because Hondas are very reliable cars. 

Then I'm assuming that you want your car to be reliable. You don't like to have to take it in to the mechanic all the time. You don't want it to break down on the road. And if you want reliability and I want reliability, then we can start from the assumption that reliability is a good thing and that that's a reason to buy a car that is reliable. But of course you might say, well, but are Hondas reliable? And then I might appeal to an authority. Well, it's obvious that they are, or Consumer Reports has done a study that shows that they're reliable. 

And I can appeal to an authority and if you accept that authority, you go Consumer Reports, we can trust them. Then my argument's going to work. You're going to have a reason to believe the conclusion, and it might persuade you, and make you come to believe the conclusion. 

But, suppose that someone is going to raise an objection. They say, well, Consumer Reports has been wrong before, they might be wrong this time. 

Well, then I need to discount that objection. I need to respond to it and say, well, maybe they have been wrong sometimes but this time, you know, they've got a good study and it was careful or whatever, and the but means I'm discounting the objection that you raised, and I might even discount it in advance. 

Or I might just guard my claim. I might say well, they might be right in this case or they're probably right without claiming that they definitely are right. So, I can assure you by citing some kind of authority. I can discount objections and I can guard my premises by saying, well, it's probably right, instead of saying it's definitely right. And those are three ways of solving the skeptical regress problem in everyday life that we're going to look at in much more detail in the next three lectures. But the point of this lecture has been more general. In order to solve the skeptical regress problem, you have to find some assumptions that you and your audience share. They might be assumptions about the premises of your arguments. They might be assumptions about authorities that supposedly support your premises and they accept as authorities, or whatever. But there have to be some assumptions that you share with your audience in order to get the argument going. 

And that's kind of tricky, because it's going to depend on the context. 

If you're dealing with an audience that shares a lot of your assumptions, then argument's going to be relatively easy. But if you're dealing with an audience that doesn't share any of your assumptions, it's going to be impossible, and in areas where there's lots of disagreement, it's going to be hard to get your arguments going because your premises are going to be questioned and denied or rejected by the people in the audience. So what these tricks do is they give you ways to get the argument going, but they're not going to work in every case. And we'll have to look at that, as we're looking at these three different ways to solve the skeptical regress problem in the next three lectures. 

至此 我们已经了解到怎样去识别一个论证 并将之纳入了标准的形式 同时我们还 了解到 按照论证的定义 论证中的前提倾向于成为其结论的原因 

好很好 “倾向于”成为其结论的原因 恩 “倾向于”是不错 但如果能真的做到这一点就更好了 我们需要弄清楚的是 怎么才能说一个人 成功地给出了真正能成为其结论之原因的诸前提 要言不烦 我们就来关注那些以“证明”为其目的的论证 

接下来的问题是 你如何才能是你给出的前提 证明你所持的那个结论呢？ 那么 想象一下 如果你不知道火星上是否有任何生命 你没有关于此的任何形式的证据 然后你问一个朋友 然后那个朋友说 哈 我知道火星上有生命的 我可以证明给你看 在这里 这样的一段论证将告诉你火星上确实有生命 

火星上至少有一个细菌 因此 火星上是有生命的 现在 请注意 如果这个前提是真实的 得出的结论也必定是真实的 如果你和你的朋友 被说服去坚信 这一前提 则你和你的朋友也就 同样被说服来坚信这一结论了 所以 到目前为止 这一段论证看上去还不错啊 

不过 当然也你要问你的朋友 你怎么知道火星上至少有一个细菌呢？ 假设你的朋友说 恩 我、我就是瞎猜啊 这样的话 这个论证就明显不怎么样了 如果说 我们没有理由相信这一前提 因为你的朋友 只是在猜测 并且如果你也没有被说服去坚信那个前提 那么 那个前提还怎么让你被说服来相信这个结论呢？ 

推而广之 在一段论证中 除非你被说服去相信其前提 否则它就无法说服你相信其结论 

现在我们再假设 如果你的朋友说 但我这儿的确有支持这一前提的理由 我真的有！ 然后 我们就要问 这个理由是什么样的？ 那么 到了这一步 你的朋友就需要 阐述这个理由 那我们该如何阐述理由呢？ 我们通过论证阐述理由 因此你的朋友就需要为这一前提做出另一段论证 而这第一段论证的前提 恰是第二段论证的结论 但是且慢 现在我们就遇到点儿麻烦 因为 由于第二段论证其自身也需要一些前提 而你又必须首先被说服去相信这些前提 因此这第二段论证的诸前提亦需要是第三段论证的结论 如此等等 因为第三段论证亦需要前提 他们也需要被证明 所以他们就必须要是其它论证的结论 着其它的论证 也各有其前提 而又各自 要是另外的证明的结论 如此无穷无尽 如此说来我们好像是遇到了一个大问题了 

为了使得诸前提具有说服力 他们必须 依凭一个论证来证明之 但一个论证 又会有其自己的前提 这一前提又需要依凭 另一个论证 如此等等 这个问题被称为“无穷回溯问题” 因为你总要倒退回一个又一个的论证 一个又一个 一个又一个 一个又一个 一个又一个 一个又一个… 如此一来这样的循环根本就没有尽头 看来只有三种方法能够解决掉无穷回溯 第一个方法 我们以一个不合理的前提开始论证 如果它不合理 那我们也就不必为之找到一个论证 来作依凭了 这也就是说你将不会陷入到 一个链条中 在这链条里论证依凭论证 又复依凭另一个论证 如是无止无休 第二种可能的方法是 构建一个论证间的循环关系 

也就是说 一个论证为另一个论证所证明 而 另一论证又为第三个论证所证明 第三个论证 复为第四个论证所证明 而第四个论证则能为第一个论证所证明 如是则这些论证构成了一种循环关系 第三种可能性是 论证的链条可以无限地倒退 永无终结 每一个命题都有一个论证作为其依凭 这样的链条是没有一个终点的 你将永远无法找到一个前提 能够不依靠其它论证而成立 因为这链条是无限的 

以上这些似乎就是我们可能避免怀疑倒退的三种方法 这样 第一种方法 也就是我们以一个不合理的前提作为论证的开端 这看起来十分简洁 如果你能就此了事的话 但是 我们已经看到为什么这 将不起作用了 我们刚才举例说你的朋友辩称火星上有生命 因为火星上至少有一个细菌 而这只不过是他的猜测 如果你只是依靠猜测得出前提 那你也就没有理由去相信它们 也就是说 使用这些前提的论证 是无法说服你相信其结论的 但除此之外 让我们这样来想 如果我们让你以不合理的前提作为论证的开端 你就可以证明任何结论 而如若你能够不依靠任何理由 完全编造出前提 那你也就没什么不能相信的了 甚至包括那些明显是虚假的事情 因此 以不合理之前提作为论证的开端 这看起来是一个真正的问题 接下来 我们再来看回应怀疑倒退的第二种方法 也就是我们使用一种循环的结构 你想想看 这种方法也是颇为简洁的 因为 如果你想要去证明一个命题 你需要在另一命题的基础上来证明之 接着你需要在第三个命题的基础上证明第二个命题 第三个则第四个为基础 第四个以第五个为基础 而最后 第五个又以第一个为基础 如是则你已然构建出了这个循环 而这些论证在这一循环中进行 但这就意味着 每一个前提都有了 一个论证作为其依凭 因为你可以无限地在这个循环中上溯 

而如果你稍微思索一下这种方法 它很明显 不怎么样 我们来看一看最小的循环是什么样 就能明白为什么了 

那么 假设你的朋友说 我能够证明火星上有生命 以下是我的论证 火星上有生命 因此 火星上有生命 —这显然不怎么样！ 而它之所以不怎么样的原因 在于如果 我们一开始并不知道火星上是否有生命 我们就无法知道这一前提是否正确 这是因为如果你不知道结论 你也就不知道前提 因为由于前提正是结论 

所以 如果你一开始没有理由相信 结论 你也就没有理由 相信前提 而这就意味着  这一论证实际并没有证明任何东西 而只是在其开始的地方就结束了 并且 同样的问题其实也在第一种方法中出现了 就是那个包含有不合理之前提的方法 因为你可以使用循环论证来证明所有的事情 你可以证明火星上有生命 火星上有生命 因此 火星上有生命 你同时又可以证明 

没有火星上存在生命 火星上有没有生命 因此 火星上有没有生命 你怎么样都可以 然而 如果一个论证既能被用于证明一个结论 也可以被用于证明另一个结论 这样的论证就有很大的问题了 接下来我们就来看第三种 也是最后一种 可以避免无穷回溯的方法 也就是说 使用一个无限的论证链条的方法 但是如果我们在一个具体的情境中来思考 我们就会发现它还是有问题的 

假设你的朋友说 火星上有生命的 我可以证明这一点 你就说那好啊 给我个理由吧 

嗯 火星上至少有一个细菌呀 因此 火星上有生命 你就说 行吧 很好 但是你怎么 知道火星上至少有一个细菌呢？ ”对此我就有另一个论证啊” 他说 

火星上 至少有两个细菌 因此 火星上至少有一个细菌 那你怎么知道至少有两个细菌呢？ 嗯 火星上至少有三个细菌 因此 火星上至少有两个细菌 但你怎么知道有至少有三个吗？ 嗯 火星上至少有四个细菌 所以至少有三个 嗯 至少有五个 所有至少有四个 嗯 至少有六个 因此至少有五个 如是无穷无尽 你可以永远这样进行下去 因此 一个无限的论证链条 将允许你证明火星上有生命 即便关于火星上有没有细菌 你一点证据也没有 如果你想要进行一段论证 而你论证所依凭的那些前提 并不具有独立的说服力 则这样的无限的链条 并不能对你的论证证明其结论的可信性有任何帮助 从没有一个独立的理由 则是无限的链 将是一点好处都没有正当的结论是这样的说法 因此 许多人 将无穷回溯问题看做一个深刻而严肃的哲学问题 如果“不合理的前提”之方法不能奏效 “循环结构”之方法不能奏效 而论证的无限链条之方法也行不通 那我们 就很难看到避免无穷回溯问题的希望了 也就是说 我们都不知道有什么样的论证 能够 我至少真正真正说服我们相信一件事 哲学家们对此真的是挠头不已 长久以来他们都对此十分担忧 这一问题甚至让他们难以入眠 

但是 我们在这里还是要看看 在实际生活中人们是怎么解决与之类似的问题的 那么在日常生活中 我们是如何解决无穷回溯问题的呢？ 嗯 这就有各种技巧 你都可以用 例举个例子 一个办法会从一个每个人都认同的前提开始 目前为止 我的想法是所以 

如果我说 你真的准备买一辆本田车么？ 因为本田是非常可靠的车 

这样我就假设你想买一辆可靠的车啊 你不想总得带它去见修车师傅 你也不想半路上车坏了 如果你也需要可靠性而我也需要可靠性 那么我们就可以 假设的可靠性是一件好事 而这就是 要买一辆可靠的车子的理由 但是你当然也可能说 那么 本田车真的可靠吗？接着我可能就会引用一个权威的意见 嗯 本田车很明显是很可靠的啊 或者我说《消费者报道》 已经做了研究 表明本田车是可靠的 

这样我可以诉诸权威 而如果 你也接受这一点 这个权威 就比如《消费者报道》 是值得信赖的 那么我的论证 也就成立了 这样你就有理由相信这一结论了 而这一论证也可以说服你 使你最终相信这一结论 

但是 假如有人会提出反对意见 他们说 恩 《消费者报告》毕竟也犯过错误 因而他们这次也可能是错的啊 

那么 这样我就必须要反驳这反对意见 我需要作出回应 说 好吧 也许他们以前偶尔犯错 但是这一回 你也知道 他们的研究做的不错 挺仔细的 “但是”一次 在这里就意味着我试着在反驳你提出的反对意见 而我甚至还可以进一步反驳它 

或者 我也可以仅仅是捍卫我自己的说法 我可能会说 他们这次应该是对的 或者 他们可能是对的 而不是声称它们是绝对正确的 目前为止 我的想法是所以 我可以通过援引某些权威来说服你 我还可以反驳反对意见 我也可以只说我的诸前提可能是正确的 而不是说它们是绝对正确的 以期为我的诸前提做出辩护 以上就是现实生活中解决无穷回溯问题的三个方法 我们接下来的三节课还要讲更多的细节 但是这堂课的要点则更为普遍一些 为了解决无穷回溯问题 你必须找到一些 你与你的听众都能认同的预设 这些预设可以是你论证的前提 也可以是那些权威意见 能够支持你的前提 而且他们作为权威的身份应该是被接受的 总之 你必须得找到一些前提 是你和你的听众都能认同的 这样论证才能进行下去 

可是这个就有点棘手了 因为这样的话就和具体环境紧密相关了 

如果你所面对的听众 与你共同认同许多的预设 那么论证也就相应地比较容易进行 但是如果你面对的听众并不与你有很共识 那么你就不可能很轻松地论证 如果有很多的不同意见的话 你想要把你的论证进行下去就很困难了 因为你的前提会被听众中的个别人 反复地质询与否认 如此说来 这三个小技巧虽能指出一种让论证进行下去的方法 但它们并不能在所有情况下奏效 这样一来我们就不得不仔细思考这三种 解决无穷回溯的不同方式 而我们将在接下来的三节课中讲到这些方法

### assuming

In the previous lecture, we looked at the skeptical regress problem and I kind of introduced three different ways of solving that problem in practical life. Namely assuring, guarding, and discounting. 

Those are three ways to solve the skeptical regress problem in practical life, and in the next three lectures what we're going to do is look at each of these, in much more detail, and more carefully, so as to understand how they work. Let's begin with assuring. 

Here's an example. I assure you that smoking is bad for your health. If I say, I assure you, then I'm trying to get you to accept that claim on my authority. Now I might have some reason for saying that smoking is bad for your health, namely, I've read the US Surgeon General's report, which cites the scientific evidence to show, that smoking is bad for your health. But notice that I don't actually say it, when I say, well it's obvious that smoking is bad for your health. Or everybody knows that smoking is bad for your health. Or I assure you, certainly, clearly, smoking is bad for your health. Then what I'm doing is I am trying to get you to accept that premise without actually citing the Surgeon General or anybody. I haven't cited the evidence. I simply have indicated to you I do have evidence. I do have a reason to believe that smoking is bad for your health, but I haven't given you what the reason is. 

So what good is that? It's a lot of good, because what it means is that if I don't give the reason, you can't question the reason. If I simply say everybody believes it, it's certainly true, then you can't ask whether those people who believe it have any reason to believe it. Or rather I have any reason to be so certain about it. If I don't give the reason, I've cut off your attack of the reason that I would give. 

So assuring is kind of tricky. I say I assure you, and if you can trust me, that's fine. But if you can't trust me, then you should be asking, well, what kind of reason does he really have? 

There are many ways to assure people. There are three kinds that we're going to look at: authoritative, reflexive, and abusive. 

Let's start with authoritative. 

Authoritative is just what it says, it cites an authority. So, I might say I assure you that smoking is bad for your health. The Surgeon General has shown that smoking is bad for your health. And I cite an authority, the Surgeon General. Okay. Fine. But, have you seen the studies? Have I cited the numbers? Have I told you when the studies were done, how many subjects, under what circumstances? Which statistical tests were used? How do you know it's causation instead or correlation and so on and so on. No, I just say the Surgeon General has shown this. And you're supposed to take my word for it that those are good studies, unless of course your share my assumption that the Surgeon General is trustworthy. So, that's the way an authoritative assurance works. It cites an authority that the audience shares as an authority with the other person. They share the assumption that that the authority is trustworthy. Now, sometimes it's the Surgeon General and the Surgeon General is pretty reliable. But you also get this kind of thing from reporters they say, an unimpeachable source close to the President has assured me that the President's plans are such and such. And they cite an unimpeachable source, but they won't tell you want the source is and they won't tell you how the source knew it was true. 

So they're citing an authority but they're not telling you what the authority is, or what reason the authority has for what the authority claims. 

Now if you trust that authority, then that's fine. And if authority's reliable, then you might be safe, but if you don't know who the authority is or where they got their information, there can be problems. 

And here's my favorite. Here's my favorite. I sometimes hear students say, but Professor [UNKNOWN] Armstrong, my teacher in the other course said that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Well, why do you trust your professors? I mean why do you trust me? You shouldn't be trusting me or your other professors any more than you're trusting an unimpeachable source close to the president. 

So, you have to trust somebody sometime, and you have to decide who you're going to trust. 

And then, it's going to be okay to cite an authority, in this kind of assurance, but you have to watch out for tricks when people start citing authorities that aren't really authorities, because even the best authorities sometimes do studies that aren't very careful, and might even be wrong. A second kind of assurance, is what I call reflexive, reflexive because it's talking about yourself. 

I believe that, I know that, I am certain that, I feel sure that. 

And you're signing something about your own mental state. You feel sure. Great, you feel sure, but why do you feel sure? Notice however, that this assurance works, because people don't want to question what other people feel sure about. If I say, well, I feel sure that this is going to happen, in many societies, it's going to be impolite to go, well, I don't feel sure. Matter of fact, I think you're wrong. Or, why do you feel sure? because then you're questioning the person. And if that's impolite, then using this type of phrase, I am certain that, will get people to shut up and not say anything. So here's an example from Monty Python. >> Now let's get one thing quite clear, I most definitely told you. But my favorite is when people say you know, I've held this opinion for years or I've thought about it year after year. It's really bothered me and you know, after careful consideration I've come to the conclusion that blah, blah, blah, whatever, and you're supposed to say, well, since you've thought about it so much, I'll save myself a lot of trouble of thinking about it, and trust you and go along with what you say. 

Well if you let other people do your thinking for you, then that's up to you. 

But you're going to be misled in some cases cause they thought about it for years and years and gotten themself into a tizzy and ended up at the wrong conclusion. So the fact that somebody's thought about it for years doesn't necessarily mean it's right. But somehow in conversation, when you say I've thought about it for a long time and checked all the sources I could, then people will take the fact that you've reached a certain conclusion to be okay for them to reach the same conclusion. And that's how this reflexive type of assurance works. 

The most fun of all is the abusive assurance. 

Here's another example from Monty Python. >> No, no, nonsense! >> Maybe he's right. Maybe it is nonsense. That the point is that he gets you to accept what he believes by abusing you and calling it nonsense. And the same thing happens when somebody says, nobody but a fool would think that. Everybody knows this. If you say, everybody knows it, then you're saying, well, if you don't know it, then you're a dummy. And so they're abusing you in order to get you to agree with them by making a conditional abuse that applies to you only if you don't agree with them. And you don't want to be a dummy. You don't want to speak nonsense. You don't want to say something that's stupid. So if somebody says, you'd have to be stupid to disagree with me about this, then that's going to incline you to agree with them. Some of these abusive assurances are a little bit more subtle, so it's worth mentioning one that's used all the time, and this is what might be called appeal to common sense. Someone says, it's just common sense that such and such. It doesn't matter what the such and such is, the point here is simply that if you deny that, then you're telling that person you lack common sense. And nobody wants to lack common sense. So by saying, it's just common sense that, it's just plain common sense. People say it all the time, but what they're doing is they're abusing their opponents by saying that their opponents lack common sense. So it's a little bit more subtle, but it shows that abuse of assurances occur either subtly or openly all the time. So we've see three different types of assurances. Okay. The first is authoritative, the second is reflexive and the third is abusive. 

And they're all used in common speech to stop the skeptical regress problem. So why do we need any of these assurances in the first place? And the answer is, we've got limited time. 

You know, you can't go out and check every study, you can't go out and look into every issue. You've just got to accept authorities and listen to other people and learn from them, or you'll never be able to figure out the issues that matter to you in life. 

So assuring can be a perfectly good thing. If you trust the Surgeon General of the United States instead of going out and starting your own laboratory and doing your own statistical studies, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. 
10:04
But when you start trusting authorities that are not worthwhile, or not trustworthy, then, you can get yourself into trouble. And we'll talk later in the course, about, ways to tell which authorities are reliable or trustworthy and which ones are not. 

That tells you why, assurances are needed in general, but what about particular cases? 

Well when you're talking to a certain audience, 

if they share your trust of a certain authority, or if they trust you when you give a reflexive assurance, or if what you're saying really is something that everybody with common sense believes in, then again, it can be perfectly fine to use an assurance. It saves you the time of having to go check out every issue and it helps you avoid the skeptical regress problem in a very practical way. So assuring can be a really useful tool in argument. But, you have to be careful because assurances are also subject to a lot of tricks that you have to learn to watch out for. We've already seen that you can cite authorities that aren't trustworthy and that's kind of obvious. 

But something that's maybe a little less obvious is that people use assurances at points in their argument in order to distract you. When something really is questionable, they often say, well, that's obvious. 

In order to get you to not pay attention to it. So when someone says that's obvious, it's certain, I'm sure, it's worth looking carefully at what they're so sure about and asking yourself whether you agree with them because people try to paper over the cracks in their arguments with these assurances, at least in some cases, and you have to learn to watch out for that. Another trick is when assurances get dropped. People will start off saying, you know, he believes this, I believe that, and then they drop it and start talking as if it's true. You know, my favorite example of this was a case a few years ago when there was a person caught in Germany for cannibalism. And it started off with the reporters saying, well he, the person accused of cannibalism says that there are lots of other cannibals in Germany. 

And then, it becomes, it is reported that there are lots of cannibals in Germany. And then it became, sources have said that, as if the sources are reliable. And pretty soon they were saying, there are lots of cannibals in Germany. And it moved from, he believes it to there are lots of them. And that's the trick of dropping the assurance in a way that can be illegitimate. So, assurances can be useful and they can also be misleading. And, that's going to be true of all the different ways of stopping the skeptical regress. There can be uses and abuses of all of these tricks. For assurances, we want to have an assurance when, first of all, somebody might question it. Second, the audience accepts the authority that is being referred to. And third, it would be too much trouble to actually cite the study and all the numbers, and the evidence, and the particular people. 

The assurances are not appropriate when nobody would question the claim anyway. Then why are you wasting your time assuring people? 

When the authority that you're basing your assurance on is not really trustworthy. Because then, why should they believe your assurances? And third when you've got plenty of time and it would be really easy to give the reasons straight-forwardly instead of simply assuring them. So, you've got good and bad uses of assurances. And I hope we understand what they are and how to distinguish them, but let's do a few exercises just to make sure that we've got the general idea. 

在上一次堂课中 我们讨论了无限回溯问题 我介绍了在现实生活中 可以解决这个问题的三种不同的方式 分别是：保证 (assuring) 让步 (guarding) 和削弱 (discounting) 

这三种方式可以解决 生活中的无限回溯问题 在接下来的三节课中 我们将逐一介绍这三种方式 并给出更多细致的讲解 以了解这三种方式的原理 我们先来看看“保证” 

举一个例子 “我保证吸烟对你的健康有害”  我说 “我保证” 我其实 是想让你认同我的权威性 也许 我说吸烟有害健康 是有原因的 比如 我看了美国卫生总监局的报告 这份报告用科学证据表明 吸烟确实有害健康 但问题是 我并没有说明为什么吸烟有害健康 我只是说 吸烟“显然”是有害健康的 或者说 “每个人都知道“吸烟有害健康 或是 “我保证” “必然的” “显而易见的” 吸烟有害健康 我所做的 就是试图让你接受这个前提 却不引用卫生总监局的 或其他任何证据 我没有提供证据 我仅仅是指出我“有”证据 我确实有理由相信吸烟有害健康 但是我没有告诉你这个理由具体是什么 

那么 这么做有什么用？ 这么做确实有好处 这意味着 如果我没有给出理由 你就没有理由可以去反对 如果我只说 “大家都相信它” “它当然是正确的” 你就不能问 那些相信它的人是不是真的都有自己的理由 或者是我如此信誓旦旦 有什么依据？ 如果我不给出理由 就能避免你对于我的理由的攻击 

所以“保证”实际上是一种诡计 我说我像你保证 如果你相信我 那没什么说的 但如果你不信任我 那你就会问 有什么证据？ 

可以有很多方式给人以保证 我们将介绍其中三种 权威型 反身型 和 侮辱型 

让我们从权威型开始 

就像字面上的意思 权威型策略强调权威 我也许会说 我保证吸烟有害健康 卫生部部长也说过 吸烟有害健康 我提到了权威——卫生部部长 好吧 不过 你亲眼看到过相关研究么？我有提到任何数据么？ 我有没有告诉你这个研究 是什么时候做的？ 有多少个被试？在什么条件下做的？ 用了哪种统计检验方法？你怎么知道吸烟和健康之间 到底是相关关系还是因果关系？ 等等… 不 我都没提 只是说卫生部部长就是这么说的 而你要相信我的话 相信这些研究是有效的 只要你和我一样 相信卫生部部长是信得过的 好 以上就是权威型策略 它提供了一个大众 认可的权威 大众一致假设认为 这个权威是值得信赖的 有时候 像卫生部部长这样的权威 确实很可靠的 但是有时你也会 从报道中读到这样的说法：据总统身边人员的可靠消息称 总统的计划是如何如何的… 他们提到一个所谓的可靠的消息来源 却不肯说这个消息来源于哪里 也不会告诉你这个消息来源何以为真 

他们指出权威 但不说明权威到底是谁 或这些权威对他们的观点有什么依据 

如果你愿意相信权威 也没问题 如果权威真的可信 你也不会有什么损失 但如果你不知道这个权威是谁 或他们是从哪里得到的消息 可能就有问题了 

这儿是我最喜欢的一个例子 我有时会听到学生说 这个著名的sin函数 阿姆斯特朗教授说 或者别的课的老师说什么什么... 你为什么会相信教授？为什么相信我？ 与“可靠的内部知情人员” 相比 你也并不应该更相信我 或其他教授 

某些时候 你必须相信某个人 必须决定要相信谁 

只有这样 才可以运用权威型的保证策略 但你要小心人们在运用权威型测量时的诡计 权威真的是权威吗？ 因为即使是最好的权威 有时也会不那么审慎 也会犯错 第二种保证方式 是反身型策略 意味着 在这种策略中人们提到的是自己 

我相信 我知道 我确定 我觉得是 

你在表达你自己的精神状态 你觉得很确定 好的 你觉得确定 但为什么你这么肯定？ 注意 这种策略之所以有效 因为人们一般不会去怀疑别人确定的事情 如果我说 我觉得很确定 这件事一定会发生 在很多社会中 说我不很确定 我觉得你是错的 或是说 你为什么这么肯定？ 是很不礼貌的 因为这样做 是在质问他人 既然这是不礼貌的 那么用这样的句子 “我确定…”会让人们闭嘴 什么都不说 这里是来自喜剧 Monty Python 中的一段 — 好的 让我把话说明 我明确告诉你 但我最喜欢的例子 是人们说 “多年以来我一直持有这个观点” 或者 “我已经考虑了很多年了” “这件事真的很困扰我 你知道 在深思熟虑了这么多年后 我得到这个结论...” 诸如此类 那么你会觉得 既然你深思熟虑这么久 那么我就不用再下功夫思考 就相信你的话吧 

如果你想让他人替代自己思考 没问题 这是你的事 

但你有可能会被误导 如果虽然他人 用了很多年时间思考 却心慌意乱 还是得出错误答案 所以 一个人对一个问题思考多年 并不代表他的答案一定就是对的 但在和别人交谈时 你说这个问题我思考了多年 考虑到了每一种可能性 人们会认为你的结论已十分可信 他们也可以认同这个结论 这就是反身型策略 

最有趣的是侮辱型策略 

这里是另一个来自喜剧Monty Python的例子 — 不 不 这完全是胡扯！ 也许他是对的 也许确实没有道理 但问题是 他通过侮辱你在胡扯 来让你同意他的观点 当人们说 “除了笨蛋没有人这么想” “每个人都知道“的时候 也用到了这个策略 当人们说“每个人都这么认为”的时候 意思是 如果你不这么认为 你就是笨蛋 所以他们通过侮辱你 来达到自己的目的 这个“条件性侮辱” 在你不同意他们的时候生效 如果你不想当笨蛋 你就不该说蠢话 不该坚持没有道理的东西 所以当人们说 笨蛋才会不同意我的观点 你就会倾向于同意他们 一些侮辱型策略更为微妙 有必要提及一个广泛使用的例子 该方法被称作“诉诸常识” 当有人说 “某事某事是常识啦” 某事到底是什么不重要 重要的是如果你反对他所说的话 那你就是个缺乏常识的人 而没人愿意做没常识的人 that aren't trustworthy and that's kind of obvious.这似乎是十分明确的 人们总在这么说 但他们其实是在 通过说对方缺乏常识来侮辱对方 When something really is questionable,当某一事物确实令人怀疑时 侮辱型保证一直发生着 要么不易觉察 要么直白公开 以上我们看到了三种不同形式的保证 好 第一个是权威型 第二个是反身型 第三个是侮辱型 

他们都用在日常的对话中 以防止无限回溯问题出现 到底为什么我们会需要这些保证措施呢？ 首先 我们的时间有限 

我们不可能去检查所有的研究 不可能去调查所有的问题 你只能接受权威的意见 或是从他人那里学习 否则你永远不能考虑清楚那些 你生活中的重要问题 

所以保证是完全可取的 如果你信任美国卫生部部长 而不是去建立自己的实验室 自己去做 统计研究 这样做一点问题也没有 

And then it became, sources have said that, as if the sources are reliable.之后 就变成了有消息指出德国有很多人吃人肉 好像消息很可靠似的 那你就会让自己陷入麻烦 接下来的课程中 我们会讲到这个 我们会讲到什么样的权威可以相信 什么样的不可以 

刚才说了为什么大体上来说 保证是必要的 但特殊的情况下呢？ 

当你和某一特定对象交谈 

如果他们和你一样信任某一权威 或是当你用反身型策略时 他们也相信你 或者你说的 确实是一些人人都持有的常识 这种情况下 用保证是完全可行的 它保证了你不用浪费时间去一个个检验 以一种十分实用有效的方法 帮助你避免无限回溯 保证真的是论证中十分有用的一个工具 但由于保证本身有可能包含 要特意学习  才会注意到的诡计 你必须十分小心 以上 我们看到了 保证可以诉诸 值得信赖的权威 这再明显不过了 

然而有时不那么容易发觉的是 人们会在论证中 利用保证来使你分心 当某一事物确实可疑时 他们通常会说： “这很明显” 

就是为了让你不去注意这个问题 所以当一些人说：“这很明显” “十分确定” “我确信” 时 仔细检查他们确定的东西 问问自己是不是真的同意 就十分必要 因为至少在某些情况下 人们会试图掩盖论证中的漏洞 你要学会 留心注意到这一点 另一个诡计 是把保证丢在一旁不管 人们一开始说 “他的看法这般 我的意见那样“ 之后他们就丢下这些保证不顾了 好像这个观点的确就是真的 举一个我最喜欢的例子 几年前 一个人在德国因为食人肉被抓 起初报道指出 这个被指控食人肉的人辩护说 德国还有很多其他食人肉的人 

于是接下来 报道就成了德国有很多食人肉的人 再之后 就变成了有消息指出 德国有很多人吃人肉 好像消息很可靠似的 很快 他们就说 德国的确是有很多人吃人肉 这件事情从 “他觉得” 到了 “事实上确实有很多人在做” 这种丢掉保证的诡计 是不合理的 无效的 所以 担保很有用 也会造成误解 在所有的避免无限回溯的方式中 都存在这样的现象 所有这些技巧都可能 被有效使用和被滥用 对于保证来说 我们希望在以下情况中得到保证 第一 人们可能会质疑的时候 第二 对方会接受我们所提到的权威意见的时候 第三 真的要列举出 研究 数据 证据 以及某个特定的人的话 是很困难的 

当没有人 去质疑某项陈述的时候 保证就没有任何必要了 那么你何必去浪费时间做保证呢 

当你所引用的权威不值得信赖 保证也不适宜 因为这样没有人会相信这个保证 当你有很多时间 要指出原因十分容易的时候 直接指出就可以了 也不需要保证 目前为止 我的想法是所以 你知道了好的保证和坏的担保都是怎样的 我希望大家都明白怎么去使用保证 并能将好的和坏的保证区分 让我们做些练习 确保你大体上懂得了本课的知识 

### guarding

The second common move in arguments that's supposed to solve the skeptical regress problem is guarding. The basic idea of guarding is very simple. It's just making the premises of your argument weaker so that there will be fewer ways in which your opponents can raise trouble for them, or show that they're false. So here's an example. Suppose someone says, we ought not to build any new nuclear power plants because they'll explode. 

Now wait a minute. How do you know that any of them really will explode? How can you tell that in the future? You don't even know what kinds of standards they're going to be built to. 

So someone could object to that argument by saying you're not justified in asserting that premise that these new nuclear power plants will explode. 

So how do you stop that problem? Well, you simply say, well, we ought not to build any new nuclear power plants because some of them might explode. Or even weaker, because I believe that some of them might explode. Now we've got a premise. I believe that some of the new nuclear power plants might explode. 

That's going to be hard to deny. I mean, what's an opponent going to do? Show that you don't really believe it? Show that it's not true, that they might explode, that there's no possibility that they'll explode, or that any of them will explode? You know I couldn't mean all of them will, just some of them. So by guarding the premise in this way, you make it more likely to be true and less subject to objection. And that's what guarding does. 

It enables you to start an argument with that premise if other people agree that it's true because it's so weak. You get them to agree to share your assumption by weakening your premises. Now of course, what happens now if someone says wait a minute, they might explode. Sure, and the sun might not come up tomorrow. All kinds of things might not happen or might happen. Might's too weak to establish that we shouldn't have new nuclear power plants. So what you're suggesting is not just that it might happen but that it's likely to happen. 

And if the chance of it happening really is so slight as to be negligible, then you've weakened the premise too much, and it's not going to follow that we shouldn't have nuclear power plants. So the issue's going to come down to is the risk of them exploding, or some of them exploding, enough to justify the conclusion that we ought not to have them. And that's going to depend on exactly how much risk there is, and by looking at the guarding term, at the might term, and questioning it, and saying, can we replace might with probably, or something like that? Then we're going to have a better handle on how to assess the argument. So, when you see someone using guarding like this you need to ask, why did they put in the guard, And have they put in too much guarding that it's weakened it so much that the conclusion no longer follows? 

So the general trick of guarding is to weaken the premise, so it's going to be harder to deny, and that's how you argue against guarding. But there are at least three different ways to do this. Okay? One is the extent. The other is probability, and the other is mental. First, guarding by extent. We need a new alcohol officer on our campus, because all students drink too much. Well that's clearly false. Not all students drink too much. 

Most students drink too much. Well not most, maybe not most. Many students drink too much. 

Okay many, too many, because it's too much. 

Some students drink too much. Notice that you can guard or weaken the claim, the premise, from all students drink too much, to most students drink too much, to many students drink too much to some students drink too much. And as you move down that scale, the premise gets harder and harder to deny. 

So, whether this counts as guarding depends on the expectation. If you expect the claim that most or all students drink too much, then it's guarding to say many, or certainly to say some. But, if you don't expect that many or most or all, than to say some, is simply to say that you're talking about some. So, it's guarding when you weaken it beyond what would otherwise be expected in the context. This standard is going to be hard to apply because it might be difficult to say what the expectations are of the different people involved in a conversation, but that's what guarding is. It's not guarding every time you use the word many or most. It's only guarding when you're expecting all, and the person instead merely claimed many. The second kind of guarding concerns probability. Some people would say it's absolutely certain that O.J. Simpson killed his wife. 

And other people say well he probably killed his wife, or it's likely that he killed his wife. And others will say, there's a chance he killed his wife, another is, will say, he might have killed his wife. So when you change from, it's certain, to it's probable, or it's likely, or there's a chance, he might have. Again, you're moving down a continuum, and the further you move down that continuum, the easier it is to defend your premise because you're claiming less. 

And the question is going to be whether you've done it too much. If you simply say he might have killed his wife, therefore he ought to be convicted, that's clearly wrong. If you say probably killed his wife, so he ought to be convicted, that might be wrong, too, if there's a strong burden on the prosecution to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. 

But you don't want to require that it's certain that he killed his wife because then you'll never be able to convict any criminals. So you need something like almost certain. You know, it's a bit of a fudge word, or beyond a reasonable doubt. In any case, however you assess whether or not he should have been convicted depending on how you assess how likely it was he really did what he was accused of, 

apart from all those questions, the point here is simply that in arguments in general, you can make the argument more defensible by weakening the premise so there are fewer ways to show that the premise is wrong. And that's the second type of guarding. Now a third type of guarding we can call mental, because it has to do with the mental state of the person asserting the premise. You might say, well, I know that the President is 50 years old. But you might say, I believe that the President is 50 years old. You might say, I tend to believe, or, I'm inclined to believe that the President is 50 years old. And there's another continuum as you move from knowledge to belief to inclination to believe. Again, you're making the premise weaker and weaker, which makes it harder and harder to question or deny or doubt that premise. So you avoided a problem for your argument, and potentially this is a way to, stop the skeptical regress. 

在解决无限回溯问题的论证当中 第二个常用的做法就是让步 让步的基本原理很简单 就是弱化你的论证中的前提 这样对方就不那么容易 对你的前提提出质疑 trouble for them, or show that they're false. 或者指出这些前提是错误的 让我们来看一个例子 假设 有人说 我们不应该再建造新的核电站 因为它们会爆炸 

请停一停 你怎么知道核电站真的会爆炸呢？ 你怎么能预知将来的事情呢？ 你甚至不知道 它们是按照什么样的安全标准建造的 

所以人们就可以通过你没有证明 这些核电站会爆炸这个前提 来反驳你的论证 

那你该怎么防止这个问题出现呢？ 你可以简单地说 好吧 我们不应该再去建造核电站 因为有些核电站也许会爆炸 或者表达得更弱化一些 因为我觉得一些核电站也许会爆炸 现在我们有了一个前提 我觉得一些新建核电站也许会爆炸 

这样的话就很难被反驳 我是说我的意思是 对方该怎么做？证明你不是“真的”相信吗？ 证明你的前提是错误的 那些核电站不可能爆炸 其中任何一个都不可能爆炸？ 我不是说所有的核电站都会爆炸 只是说其中某些核电站有这个可能 因此 像这样弱化你的前提 你可以使 你的前提更加准确 更不容易被反驳 这就是“让步”的作用 

它让别人认同你的前提 使你可以展开论述 从而你可以基于这些前提而展开一段论述 通过弱化你的前提，你让他人同意接受你的假设 当然 如果有人说 别急 他们是“也许”会爆炸 那又怎样？ Sure, and the sun might not come up tomorrow. 当然 然后第二天太阳就不会升起来了 All kinds of things might not happen or might happen. 任何事情都也许发生或也许不发生 “也许”的语气太弱了 不能用来建立“我们不能建造新核电站”这一论点 所以你要做的不仅仅是说 it might happen but that it's likely to happen. “它也许发生”而是“它很可能发生” 

And if the chance of it happening really 如果它真的发生的概率小到 is so slight as to be negligible, then you've 可以被忽略 那么你把你的前提 weakened the premise too much, and it's not going 弱化得太多了 它不能支持 to follow that we shouldn't have nuclear power plants. “我们不应该建造核电站”这一观点 因此接下来要探讨的 就是确定核电站爆炸 of them exploding, enough to justify the conclusion that we ought not to have them. 它们当中的一些爆炸带来的风险 是否足以为“我们不应该建造核电站”这一观点辩护 And that's going to depend on exactly how much 这就取决于风险有多大 我们再来看看表示让步的词语 也就是“也许” (might) 这个词 好好想想 即 我们能否用“很可能” (probably) 或别的相近的词 来替换“也许”？ 这样我们在评定论证时 就更有把握 当你看见别人使用这样的让步方法时 你需要问一问 为什么他们需要使用让步 他们是否让步过度 导致 前提被弱化得太多 以致不能支持结论？ 

所以说 让步的基本手段 是弱化前提 使你更难去反驳这些前提 你也可以这样对让步提出异议 至少有三种不同的方法 来实现这一点 Okay？ 其一是质疑程度 The other is probability, and the other is mental. 其二是可能性 其三是心理 首先看看 让步的程度：我们的校园里需要一个新的 禁酒警官 因为所有的学生都在酗酒 这显然是错的 并不是所有的学生都酗酒 

大多数学生酗酒 好吧 也不是大多是 可能不是大多数 有很多学生酗酒 

OK “很多”还是太多了 

一些学生酗酒 注意 你可以让步 或者说弱化你的陈述 弱化你的前提 将“所有学生酗酒”改为“大多数学生酗酒” 再将“很多学生酗酒”改为“一些学生酗酒” 随着你调低程度 这个前提变得越来越难以反驳 

那么 这是否称得上是让步 也取决于你的期望 如果你期望 声称“大多数”或者“所有”学生都酗酒 那么你将它改为“很多” 或者“一些” 一定是让步 但是 如果你一开始没有期望“很多” “大多数”或“全部” 那么说“一些”就是指字面上的“一些”而已 换句话说 只有当你将语境中暗示的前提弱化 才算得上是让步 这个标准 很难执行 因为对不同的人来说 他们的期望也会不同 不过让步本是如此 不是每次使用“很多”或“大多数”这两个词时 都是让步 仅是当你期望“所有” 而对方仅说“一些”时 才算是让步 第二种让步的方式 考虑到可能性 有些人会说O. J. Simpson“肯定” 杀了他的太太 

另一些人说他“很可能”杀了他的太太 或者他“可能”杀了他的太太 另一些人会说 他也许杀了他的太太 还有人会说 他或许杀了他的太太吧 这样 当你从“肯定”变为“很可能” 到“可能” 到“也许” 到“或许...吧” 这里 你在连续地弱化前提 你的前提越弱 为你的前提辩护就越容易 因为你声称的东西少了 

接下来的问题就是你是否弱化得太多了 如果你只是简单地说 他”也许“杀了他的妻子 因此应该判他有罪 那这明显不对啊 如果你说 他“很可能“杀了他的妻子 因此应当判他有罪 而如果起诉方十分需要合理质疑之上的确切证据 那么这么说也是不对的 

但你也不需要”完全确定“ 他杀了他的妻子 因为 这样的话 就不能将任何嫌疑人定罪了 所以你需要 “几乎可以确定”就可以了 这是个有点蒙混的词 或者说“排除合理质疑” 无论如何 无论你怎样评判他 是否应该被判为有罪 都取决于你认为他 的确犯了罪行的可能性有多大 

除了这些疑问 这里的关键点是 in arguments in general, you can make the argument more defensible by 总的来说 在论述中 你可以通过弱化你的前提 从而另它更少表现出错误 使你的论述更加不易被反驳 这就是让步的第二种类型 第三种类型 我们可以称之为心理 因为 它与主张这个前提的人的心理状态有关 你可能会说 好吧 我知道总统50岁了 你也可以说 我确信总统50岁了 你还可以说 我觉得 或者 我倾向于相信 总统50岁了 这是另一个连续性的变化 从客观事实 到信念 到倾向于相信 再一次地 你不断地弱化这个前提 使得要反驳或质疑这个前提越来越困难 所以你为你的论证避开了质疑 同时 也阻止了无限回溯问题的出现 

### discounting

Now the third common move in arguments, to protect premises and avoid the skeptical regress is discounting. Discounting, is basically citing the possible objection that you think other people might be thinking of, in order to head it off by providing a quick and dirty response to it right there. 

For example, you might be talking to someone and say well, I'm thinking of buying that ring and it's really beautiful. And you're thinking, well they're going to object that the ring is very expensive too. So you say, well the ring is expensive but it's beautiful. 

So what your doing is citing the objection. It's kind of odd if you think about it. If you want to buy the ring, why are you saying that its expensive? And the reason, is that you have already cited that objection, which makes it less likely that a person on the other side who doesn't want you to buy the ring, is going to say it. Because you've already said, I know that. But it's more important to me, that the ring is beautiful, so I want to buy it. So when you say, the ring is expensive, but it's beautiful, you're saying that it's expensive, that's the first thing. You're saying that it's beautiful, that's the second thing. You're saying with the word but that there's a contrast between the two, and you're indicating that the fact that it's beautiful is more important than the fact that it's expensive. You're saying all of that, simply by saying that the ring is expensive, but it is beautiful. 

So first, to say that the ring is expensive but it is beautiful is to say two things. It's like saying the ring is expensive, and it's beautiful. 

But, in other ways it's very different from and because if you say the ring is expensive and it's beautiful, you can switch them around. It's beautiful and it's expensive. It's expensive and it's beautiful. It's beautiful and it's expensive. You can say it either way. You can say it's expensive but it's beautiful. That's very different from saying it's beautiful but it's expensive. Think about it. 

If you were trying to argue for buying the ring. Which would you say. Well I would say, it's expensive, but it's beautiful. And if I'm trying to argue against buying the ring, I would say, it's beautiful, but it's expensive. 

Because the word but, indicates that the sentence after it, is in some way, more important than the other clause. You're discounting, the other objection and citing after the but clause, the reason for the belief or action that you favor. Thus, and, and but are very different. The sentence on either side of and are reversible and the sentences on either side of but are not reversible. And there are other words that are discounting phrases like but, that work the same way but fall in a different place. Consider the word although, you can say although the ring is expensive, it's beautiful and that sounds like the ring is expensive, but it's beautiful. 

Those are the sentences that someone would use if they're arguing for buying the ring because they want to emphasize that the ring is beautiful. 

The difference is that the word but occurs right before the clause that's getting emphasized, where as the word although, appears before the clause that's de-emphasized and it's the other clause that cites what the speaker takes to be more important. So, but and although are each discounting words. But the but, occurs before the emphasized clause and although occurs before the de-emphasized clause. What's common to these words like but and although is that they do three things. 

They assert two claims. They contrast those two claims. And they indicate that one of those claims is more important than the other. 

And there are lots of words that perform these functions. It's not just but and although. You have even if, even though, whereas. Nevertheless, nonetheless, still. And, as with other words that we've been studying like argument markers, for example, some of these words get used in other ways. So the word still, isn't always a discounting term. You say he's sitting still. You're not discounting an objection. It's when you use the word still at the beginning of the sentence. Still, the diamond is beautiful, or something like that. Then, the word still is getting used as a discounting word. And, like with other words we've studied, if you want to know in a particular case, whether the word still is being used as a discounting word, you ask whether you can substitute a different discounting word, and the sentence will function in basically the same way, and mean basically the same thing. And if it does, then, still is being used as the discounting word, and if it's not, then it's not being used as a discounting word, so we can use the substitution method to test for what the function of the word is. So why do people use discounting words like these? 

They use them in order to head off objections, because if you state the objection first, then your opponent seems a little silly to be saying it again. You just responded to them. 

And so, you can defend your premises or protect your premises and avoid the skeptical regress by discounting the kinds of objections, that people would raise that might seem to call for further argument. And that's a perfectly legitimate use. Sometimes you want to do that. You don't want to let your opponent raise an objection, because that might be misleading and gets you off on a tangent and it's a perfectly effective and useful legitimate move in an argument. 

But you also have to watch out, because there's some tricks associated with discounting terms. In particular I want to talk about the trick of discounting straw people. Well, one effective move in argument if you're just trying to persuade people is to make them not see the problems with your position and one way to do that is to say, I've got five objections I'm going to respond to. You know, you might say this, but. You might say that, however. You might say this, whereas. You might say that, still. You might say that, although. Right? And you discount each of those five objections, 

and yet what you do is you get to pick the objections. 

Right? So you can pick the easiest objections, not the hardest objections. And then, you've got the whole discussion focusing on the easiest objections. And as people are trying to keep all farther those in their minds straight, they forget about the other objections which might be even stronger. So you discount these straw people. Straw meaning easy to knock over. Easy to destroy. And, make people forget about, the objections that are harder to destroy that're going to cause more serious problems for your theory. 

So if you don't really want to know whether your theory's right or wrong. You're just trying to persuade people. That can be an effective move. And if you don't want to be persuaded by people who are trying to trick you like that, then you have to watch out for other people, discounting straw men and not facing the really more difficult objections to their views. 

And here's an even trickier trick. You can combine this trick of discounting straw people with other tricks that we saw for other words. So, suppose somebody says, well you know, the President is all in favor of some kind of public health service, but a public health service is not going to solve all of the medical problems of our people. So, I think the President is off on the wrong track. 

Well, notice what's happened here is you've discounted the objection that the public health service is going to solve all of the medical problems of our people. Whoever thought that a public health service would serve all of them medical problems of the people? 

So, you're discounting the straw man by using an unguarded term all. You put the unguarded term in the mouth of the objector. By not guarding it, you make their view more susceptible to refutation and make it easier for you to respond to that objection. Where as the objector really would have never used the unguarded term but would have used the guarding term like most or many. Of the health problems of our people. So by using discounting terms along with guarding terms and also assuring terms, you can make moves in argument that will point people towards issues that are framed in the way you want them to be framed instead of the way that they want them to be framed. That's the trick that you have to learn to watch out for. So here's a simple rule of thumb, when you think someone is trying to use discounting terms to lead you to look at easiest objections instead of the most difficult objections, then you can think about just forgetting the one's that this person mentioned, and ask what did they leave off the list? As a rule of thumb, that's usually a good idea. But, it's not always going to work. You're going to have to use your judgment. Still try it, maybe it will work in some of the cases where you want to stop other people from tricking you. Now, you should have a pretty good grasp on. Assuring, guarding, and discounting. Three common moves in argument, that are aimed at stopping the skeptical regress, and building common assumptions, with the people you're talking to. Let's do a few exercises, in order to contrast these three and make sure you understand them. 

Now the third common move in arguments, to 现在我们学习论证中的第三点 用削弱的方法巩固前提 避免被质疑 Discounting, is basically citing the possible objection that 削弱 主要通过提到对方可能 you think other people might be thinking of,想到的缺点 in order to head it off by providing 来阻止对方 a quick and dirty response to it right there. 

For example, you might be talking to比如说 当你和某人谈论到 someone and say well, I'm thinking of buying 好吧 我想买 that ring and it's really beautiful.那只戒指 它非常漂亮 And you're thinking, well they're going to object 然后你想到了一个缺点 that the ring is very expensive too.如 这只戒指很贵 So you say, well the ring is expensive but it's beautiful.所以你可以说 这只戒指很贵 但很漂亮 

So what your doing is citing the objection. 这种方法就是在提到缺点 It's kind of odd if you think about it. 仔细想想 这种说法挺怪的 If you want to buy the ring, why are you saying that its expensive? 如果你想买这只戒指 为什么还要说它很贵呢? And the reason, is that you have already cited that原因在于 你提到了一个缺点 objection, which makes it less likely that a person on the other side这个缺点使得 who doesn't want you to buy the ring, is going to say it.不想让你买戒指的人闭嘴 Because you've already said, I know that. 因为你已经表示了你想到了它的缺点 But it's more important to me, that the ring is beautiful, so I want to buy it.但是我认为最重要的是 这只戒指非常漂亮 所以我想买下它 So when you say, the ring is expensive, but it's所以当你说 这只戒指很贵 但是 beautiful, you're saying that it's expensive, that's the first thing.很漂亮 你提到的第一件事是价格贵 You're saying that it's beautiful, 戒指很漂亮 that's the second thing.这是其次 You're saying with the word but that 你还在句子里用到了但是 there's a contrast between the two, and you're 在两件相反的是之间 indicating that the fact that it's beautiful is 用来表明戒指漂亮 more important than the fact that it's expensive.远比价格重要 You're saying all of that, simply by saying 你所说的 简洁地用 that the ring is expensive, but it is beautiful.戒指很贵 但是很漂亮表达出来了 

So first, to say that the ring is expensive所以 首先说戒指价格高 but it is beautiful is to say two things.然后说但是戒指漂亮 是在表达两件事 It's like 这就像 说：戒指很贵 并且它很漂亮 

But, in other ways it's very different from and because if you但是 这两种说法十分不同 say the ring is expensive and it's beautiful, you can switch them around.戒指很贵 与漂亮 这两句话可以颠倒顺序 It's beautiful and it's expensive. It's expensive and it's beautiful.它很漂亮 也很贵 它很贵 也很漂亮 It's beautiful and it's expensive. You can say it either way.它漂亮 也很贵 你可以用任何一种说法 You can say it's expensive but it's beautiful. 当你说 它很贵但是很漂亮 That's very different from saying it's beautiful but就不同于 它很漂亮但是 it's expensive. Think about it.很贵 想想看 

If you were trying to argue for buying the ring. 如果你为想买戒指 Which would you say.那么你可以说 Well I would say, it's expensive, but it's beautiful.它很贵 但是很漂亮 And if I'm trying to argue against buying the如果我反对买戒指 ring, I would say, it's beautiful, but it's expensive. 我可以说 它很漂亮 但是很贵 

Because the word but, indicates that the sentence 因为但是这个词 可以表示在它之后的句子 after it, is in some way, more important某种程度上 比其它子句 than the other clause. You're discounting, the other objection 更加重要 如果你用削弱的方法 将缺点 and citing after the but clause, the reason for the belief及其它引用放在但是的后面 表达你喜欢 or action that you favor. Thus, and, and but are very different. 某种想法或行动的原因 因此但是这个词非常特殊 The sentence on either side of and are reversible and 和两边的句子可以互换 the sentences on either side of but are not reversible.但是两边的句子不可以互换 And there are other还有其他 words that are discounting phrases like but, that work词可用来做削弱词语 比如 但是这个词 the same way but fall in a different place. Consider the word although, you can say although the ring is expensive, it's 想想虽然这个词 你可以说虽然戒指很贵 beautiful and that sounds like the ring is expensive, but it's beautiful.但是很漂亮 就等同于说 戒指很贵但是很漂亮 

Those are the sentences that someone would use if they're 可以把这种句子用于 arguing for buying the ring because they want to emphasize that 为买戒指而论证 因为他们的重点在于 the ring is beautiful.戒指很漂亮 

The difference is that the word but occurs right before 两个词的不同点是 用但是这个词时 the clause that's getting emphasized, where as the word although, 重点在但是之后 用虽然这个词时 appears before the clause that's de-emphasized and it's the other 重点在虽然的子句之后 clause that cites what the speaker takes to be more important. 之后的子句才是说话者的重点 So, but and although are each discounting words. 所以 但是和虽然都是削弱词语 But the but, occurs before the emphasized但是"但是"这个词 出现在强调句之前 clause and although occurs before the de-emphasized clause.虽然这个词 在非强调句之前 What's common to these words like but and although is that they do three things. 类似于“但是”和“虽然”这类词有三个共同点 

They assert two claims. They contrast those two claims.它们包含两个判断句 两个判断句的意思相反 And they indicate that one of those claims is more important than the other.它们强调其中一句与其他相比重要得多 

And there are lots of words that perform these functions.还有好多词语有这种功能 It's not just but and although.不只是但是和虽然 You have even if, even though, whereas. 还有even if even though whereas Nevertheless, nonetheless, still.Nevertheless, nonetheless, still And, as with other words that we've been studying like argument 其中一些论证词汇 markers, for example, some of these words get used in other ways.在其他语境中有不同的用法 So the word still, isn't always a discounting term.比如still这个词 You say he's sitting still. You're not discounting an objection.他还坐着 就不是削弱的用法 It's when you use the word still at the beginning of the sentence.只有still在句首时才有削弱的用法 Still, the diamond is beautiful, or something like that.尽管如此 这颗钻石还是很漂亮的 或者其他类似的 Then, the word still is getting used as a discounting word.这样 still这个词才算是削弱词语 还有 类似我们学过的其他词 如果你想探究 in a particular case, whether the word still is being used在特定情况下 判断still这个词是否有 as a discounting word, you ask whether you can substitute a 削弱的作用 你可以用其他的削弱词汇 different discounting word, and the sentence代替它 如果句子 will function in basically the same 的功能基本一样 意思也大体没变 And if it does, then, still is being used as 如果是这样 那么still这个词 the discounting word, and if it's not, then it's not being是削弱词汇 如果不是 那么still就 used as a discounting word, so we can use the substitution 不做削弱词汇 所以我们可以用代替 method to test for what the function of the word is.的方法去检验词语的作用 So why do people use discounting words like these?那么为什么人们这样用削弱词语呢? 

They use them in order to head off objections, because 我们可以用他们来避免对方的异议 因为 if you state the objection first, then your opponent seems如果你先表达了反对意见 那么对方 a little silly to be saying it again. You just responded to them.再重复一遍就会很傻 你只需回应他们 

And so, you can defend your premises or这样你可以巩固自己的前提 protect your premises and avoid the skeptical regress by 保护自己的前提 避免被 discounting the kinds of objections, that people would 种种可以削弱前提的反对意见质疑 人们 可能会引起进一步争论的异议 这是一个正当的用法 可以使用 你不希望对方提出 反对意见 因为这可能产生误导 甚至使让你的论证跑题 （这时可以）快速并且合理地插入一个论点 

但是你也要小心 因为还有些与削弱论证有关的技巧 特别地 我想谈谈与削弱论证有关的小技巧 你在尝试说服别人时 如果你只是在试图说服别人 让他们别去管你遇到的问题 do that is to say, I've got five objections I'm going to respond to. 你可以这么说 我有五个方法可以用来回应 You know, you might say this, but. 你知道 你可以这么说 但是 You might say that, however. You might say this, whereas.你可以说 然而 还能这么说 whereas You might say that, still. You might say that, although. 还可以说 still 或者 although 对吧? And you discount each of those five objections, 你在削弱这五个异议 

and yet what you do is you get to pick the objections.而且你有五个可以削弱异议的选择 

对吧? So you can pick the easiest objections, not the hardest objections. 那么你可以找到最容易的异议 别选最难的 And then, you've got the whole discussion focusing on the easiest objections.然后 你要针对最容易的这个反对意见进行讨论 And as people are trying to keep all farther those in their当人们试着进一步保持他们的 minds straight, they forget about the意见 而逐渐忘记那些 other objections which might be even stronger.更有力的反对意见 So you discount these straw people. 这时你就可以削弱这些容易打倒的人们 Straw meaning easy to knock over.Straw是容易击败的意思 Easy to destroy.轻松毁灭 And, make people forget about, the objections that are harder让人们忘记更有力的反对意见 to destroy that're going to cause more serious problems for your theory. 摧毁你的理论 甚至引起一系列麻烦 

So if you don't really want to know whether your theory's right or wrong. 因此 如果你没有真的想好你的理论是否正确 You're just trying to persuade people. That can be an effective move.只是在试着说服别人 那么削弱可以是一个有效办法 And if you don't want to be persuaded by people who are trying to trick you当然 如果你并不像被别人说服 他们正用这种小伎俩迷惑你 like that, then you have to watch out for other people, discounting straw men and 那么你就该注意正在用削弱方法的人 not facing the really more difficult objections to their views. 并且不要面对那些难度高的反对意见 

And here's an even trickier trick.这里还有一个更狡猾的技巧 You can combine this trick of discounting straw people你可以结合几种削弱的技巧 一起迷惑别人 with other tricks that we saw for other words.用之前我们学过的几个词 So, suppose somebody says, well you know, the假设对方说 你知道 President is all in favor of some kind of 总统们都对 public health service, but a public health service公共健康服务感兴趣 但是公共健康服务 is not going to solve all of the medical problems并没有解决所有人的 of our people.医疗问题 So, I think the President is off on the wrong track.所以 我认为总统们的思路有问题 

Well, notice what's happened here is 现在 注意这里发生了什么 you've discounted the objection that the public你对公共医疗服务提出反对意见 health service is going to solve all of the medical problems of our people.它没能解决所有人的医疗问题 Whoever thought that a public health service would 谁曾想到公共医疗服务将 serve all of them medical problems of the people?解决所有人的医疗问题 

So, you're discounting the straw man by using an unguarded term all. 那么 你可以用人们毫无防备的词语削弱他们 You put the unguarded term in the 让对方说出一个 mouth of the objector. 毫无防备的术语 By not guarding it, you make their view more susceptible to 别去让步 这可以更容易地 refutation and make it easier for you to respond to that objection.驳斥他们 并且很容易回应他们说的反对意见 Where as the objector really would have never used the unguarded term but would have used the guarding term like most or many.但是可能用让步词汇 比如 绝大多数或很多 Of the health problems of our people.的患者 So by using discounting terms along with guarding terms and 通过用削弱词语和让步词语 also assuring terms, you can make moves in argument 还有保证词语 会使你的论证得到进步 that will point people towards issues that are framed in the 因为这可以让人们陷入一个 way you want them to be framed instead of the way that they want them to be framed.你布下的陷阱 而不是他们就不能得逞了 That's the trick that you have to learn to watch out for.这个技巧你得学着小心 So here's a simple rule of thumb, when you think someone is trying to use 有一个经验法则 当你认为有人试着 discounting terms to lead you to look at easiest对你用削弱法则 试图把你引导到最容易的 objections instead of the most difficult objections, then you can反对意见 而不是最难的 那么你可以 think about just forgetting the one's that this person忘掉对方 mentioned, and ask what did they leave off the list?提到的 然后问问他们有没有遗漏 As a rule of thumb, that's usually a good idea.根据经验法则 这通常是个好办法 But, it's not always going to work.但是这种方法并不总是有用 You're going to have to use your judgment. Still try 你可以判断一下 不过还是要试一下 it, maybe it will work in some of the也许这招会有用 cases where you want to stop other people from tricking you.阻止对方对你使小花招 Now, you should have a pretty good grasp on.现在 你应该对 Assuring, guarding, and discounting.保证 让步 削弱有一定了解了 Three common moves in argument, that are aimed at stopping the三个常用的论证常用的方法 旨在防止 skeptical regress, and building common assumptions,被质疑 建立常用的假设 with the people you're talking to.在和别人谈话的时候 Let's do a few exercises, in order 让我们来做些小练习 to contrast these three and make sure you understand them. 来对比这三种方法，确保你真的明白了 

### evaluation

There's one more kind of language that we need to discuss, because it's also used to stop the skeptical regress. Much like assuring and guarding and discounting, and this language is Evaluative. Just imagine, that a politician says, You ought to support my healthcare plan, because it would be good for the country. What is the word good doing here? Some philosopher's going to tell you that the word good is just a way of expressing your emotions. Or maybe telling you what to do. So the politician is saying, Yay, for my healthcare plan or telling you in an imperative form, you ought to support my healthcare plan. But that can't really be the whole story, because when someone says, Yay, Duke, like I do when I cheer for the Duke team. First of all I'm not saying that the team is good, I might cheer for the Duke team, even when I know they're not good. And secondly, you can't ask me why. If I say, Yay, Duke, it doesn't make any sense if you turn to me and say, but why? Why, yay Duke? It don't make any sense. So, merely to express your emotions with something like Yay, Duke, is very different from saying Duke has a good team. And saying Yay for my healthcare plan, is very different from saying that the healthcare plan is good for the country. Similarly, if I say, I don't like fish, so we shouldn't have fish for dinner. Well, I don't really owe you a reason. I can just say I just don't like the taste of fish, end of story, leave me alone. 

I don't owe you a reason for why I don't like fish, I just don't. But, if I say it's immoral to eat fish, it's wrong to eat fish. You ought not to eat fish. It's a very different story, now I owe you a reason. If I say, it's immoral to eat fish I need to say what's immoral about it? I need to point to some feature of eating fish that makes it immoral. I can't just use that evaluative language without some kind of reason to back it up, that would be illegitimate. So, what that shows is that merely expressing preferences is very different from making an evaluation and saying that something is good or bad or right or wrong or immoral or moral. And one way to capture this feature evaluative language is to interpret a word like Good as meets the standards and Bad as violates the standards. Notice it's very vague, because it doesn't tell you what the standards are and those standards will change from one context to another. If you're talking about a good painting, the standards of a good painting are different from when you're talking about say a good investment. Where the standards are going to be completely different from the aesthetic case. 

So, if we interpret good as meets the standards, and we say, my health care program is good for the country. Then that means, it meets the standards for what will make the country function in a certain way. 

Whereas if we say, eating fish is immoral, what we're saying is that eating fish violates a certain kind of standard. And more specifically it's a moral standard. That's why we use the word immoral. So we can interpret this language in terms of meeting or violating standards. And then, to give the reason, why it's good or bad, or right or wrong, or moral or immoral. We can cite the standard and apply it to the case in order to give a reason for why the evaluation holds. But now, here's the trick, when we call it good, we don't say what the standards are. We leave that up to the context to specify what kind of standard we're talking about. So, it's kind of like assuring, when you say, I assure you, and you might cite some, authority or tell them that you have some reason, and you don't tell them what the reason is. When you call it good, you say it does meet the standards, but you don't say the standards are. So, by alluding to the standards without actually laying them out, you have made your claim a little more defensible. Because, if you lay out the standards, they might be questionable and your audience would know exactly what to question and what to deny and how to object. But, if you simply say it's good, and all you're saying is, it meets the standards. Then, you've avoid it on objection and made your premise more defensible. And that's how this type of evaluation of language might help to stave off the skeptical regress. And here's another way evaluation can help. We don't always have to agree what the standards are. Suppose you're driving down the road and I say, you know we ought to turn left here. And you say, yeah we ought to turn left here. Well I might think that we ought to turn left here, because that's going to be a quicker way to get to our destination. But you might think that we ought to turn left here, because that's going to be a more beautiful view and you'll be able to look out on the hills. 

But, we can agree that we ought to turn left here. Cause, we both agree that turning left meets the standards, even though my standards are efficiency and getting there quickly. And your standards are aesthetic and getting beautiful views. So if you can get more people to agree to your premise simply by saying this health care plan will be good for the country, without saying exactly how it's going to be good. Then you've avoided people disputing your objections, because they can agree to it since they can use their own standards to determine whether it is good or not. And that could be yet another way to avoid the skeptical regress. Notice that evaluation can occur at a lot of different levels. We have some words that are very abstract like good and bad and ought and ought not, should, should not, right, wrong. 

And those words can be used in a lot of different context. You can have the wrong investment, or a good investment. Or an investment that you ought to make. But you can also drive on the right path, or a bad path or a way that you ought not to go. And so, you can have navigational standards and economic standards, but they can all be expressed by these very general abstract evaluative words. Like good and bad and right and wrong and ought and out not and should and should not and so on. But other evaluative words are much more specific. Now, for example, you can call a painting beautiful or ugly. 

But you don't call fertilizer beautiful or ugly. You would never say that a stock is beautiful or ugly. They're just not the kind of thing to be evaluated in that way. So an evaluative word like beautiful or ugly is more specific. It only applies to a small range of things. Things whereas other words apply like good and bad, apply to almost anything. Here's another example. Cruel or brave, a person can be cruel or brave. But you can't say that a painting is cruel or brave. Or a desk is cruel or brave, or a chair is cruel or brave. A chair might be comfortable. 

But a painting is not comfortable, and a soldier is not comfortable. Soldiers are brave or not, chairs are comfortable or not, but chairs are not brave or not, and soldiers are not comfortable or not. So these evaluative words like brave or cowardly, and beautiful are ugly, or comfortable or uncomfortable. Apply only to limited ranges of things, rather than to just about anything. So we have very general, or abstract devaluative words, and we have more specific More concrete evaluative words. And, of course, which ones are specific or concrete will vary. Some are more concrete than others. It's not an absolute dichotomy. But, some words that are evaluative really will apply to almost anything. And other words apply to a more limited class. And they vary in how limited that class of things they apply to will be. So you might ask, why are all these words evaluative words? Think about it. If you want to explain a more limited evaluative word like beautiful, you want to explain what it means. You need to define it in terms of the more general words, like good. If you want to say it's beautiful, you can say that kind of means looks good. I know that's not quite right, but basically, when you want to define the word beautiful, you need to cite one of the more general words good. And then cite the specific way in which it's good, namely, the way it looks. And when you want to say an economic word like bargain. Bargain means a good price. It sells for a good price, and a good price is a low price. So, when you define what a bargain is, you need to cite the word good in order to define bargain. So the relation between these very general evaluative words and the more specific evaluative words that makes them all evaluative. Is that you need to define the specific evaluative words in terms of the more general ones. So it all comes down to what makes something evaluative is its connection to what's good or bad or right or wrong or what ought or ought not to be done or should or shouldn't be done and so on. You know, the trickiest cases of evaluative words are, words that are contextually evaluative. They don't actually get defined by good or bad or right and wrong as their general meaning. But they do suggest an evaluation in a particular context. Let me give you an example of what I mean. A conservative politician might criticize her opponent by saying, Wow, his policies are way too liberal. Now, by calling them liberal, is that a criticism? Well, she intends it as a criticism, but does the word liberal mean that it's bad? 

Not really if you think about it, because the opponent might say, i'm proud to be a liberal. Being liberal's good, yes it's liberal, so what? Yes it's liberal, nothing wrong with that. The word liberal by itself doesn't mean that it's bad, even though the conservative thinks that things that are liberal are bad. So that word liberal is not evaluative in the strict sense, because it doesn't get defined by the words good or bad or right or wrong or should or should not. It's only evaluative in the context. It suggests an evaluation, because of the assumptions of the speaker, but it doesn't in and of itself mean that anything is bad, or good, for that matter. Because of this difference, we will call language evaluative only when it's openly and literally evaluative. So that it gets defined in terms of words like good or bad or right or wrong, and not when it's merely contextually evaluative. That is in the context given the assumptions of the speaker. This person needs to be suggesting an evaluation. If they're not openly, saying, this is good or bad or right or wrong, then, they're not really, using what language that we will call, evaluative. But there're a couple of tricky examples that are worth bringing up, okay? You might think, that if you take two good things, and put them together, it gets better. And when you add a bad thing to a good thing, it makes it worse. At least, that's the way it usually works. But notice, that when you say something's good, that suggests it's good. But when you say eh, it's pretty good, then you just added pretty, which is something good, to the word good. But, pretty good, it's not really any better than good, it might even be worse, but then you can add a negative word in the middle. huh, that was pretty darn good. Well that means it's very good, so you're actually taking a negative word darn and putting it in the middle of two positive words, pretty and good, and made something that means very good. So you really have to think carefully about exactly what the language means. It's not going to be a simple formula of adding and subtracting goods and bads to figure out whether the language is evaluative. Now another word that's surprising is the word too. 

I like spicy food so when I say, this food is spicy. 

That's good or, at least, it's neutral. To say it's spicy to me means I'm probably going to like it, but notice that if we just add that little word too. If I were to say this food is too spicy, that means it's bad. The little word too takes a positive evaluation or sometimes just something that's neutral and makes it bad. So the word too is actually a negative evaluative word, because it turns what was neutral or positive into something bad. It moves it in that negative evaluative direction. So it's a negative evaluative word. So is there anything wrong with using evaluative language? No, some people seem to think that you shouldn't evaluate at all that you should just describe. But they're just kidding themselves. Try going through life without deciding what's good or bad or right or wrong or what you ought or ought not to do. You can't really live your life without making evaluations at some point. 

So it's a mistake to think that evaluation is always bad. Of course, when you do evaluate, it's not like saying Yay, Duke. 

You have to give a reason. So you should think about the standards that you're applying and why they apply to this case. That's going to be your reason for evaluating the thing as good or bad. Because often going to be hard to come up with the exact standards that you're applying. Because people tend to think of things as good or bad without getting very specific about what the standards are. So you're not always going to be able to tell people what your standards are, and when you ask them, they're not always going to be able to specify what their standards are. But it's still going to be useful exercise, whenever you make an evaluation to think about why you think this thing is good or bad, or right or wrong. What are the standards that you're applying? And when somebody disagrees with you, to ask about what their standards are. So that you can understand where the disagreement is coming from. Although evaluation can be very useful and legitimate, it can also be dangerous. Because some people use evaluative terms without reasons. Let's call that Slanting. You slant when you use an evaluative word and don't give any justification for that use of the word. So you might call somebody an idiot or a queer and you're using an evaluative word or at least you take it to be negatively evaluative. And you haven't given any reason why there's anything wrong with what you're calling that nasty word. 
15:41
Now, that's slanting if you don't have any reason and that can be terribly illegitimate. When do people do it? Well they typically do it when they don't have any reason. If you don't have any reason for your evaluation you just use some nasty name like, you idiot. And, so when people start using language like that. When they start slanting then that's a good indication to you as a critic that that's the point at which their argument is probably week. Their using that kind of language to paper over cracks as I put it before in their argument. So as to hide what's the real weakness. So we can to use evaluative language in arguments, and how it gets placed at certain points to signal where the weaknesses, and the strengths, in the argument are. So now, what we've got, is we've got Argument Markers, we've got Assuring Terms, Guarding Terms, Discounting Terms, Evaluative Language. And in the next few lectures, we're going to look at a general technique that looks at all those different types of language. And uses those different categories to analyze some real passages that we found in newspapers. 

But before that, let's do a few exercises, just to make sure that you understand Evaluation. 

还有一种语言我们需要来探讨一下 因为这种语言也常常被用来中止无限回溯 这种和保证，让步，削弱相似的语言 叫做评价 试想一下 如果有个政客说 你应该支持我的医疗政策方案，因为它会给我们的国家带来好处。 “好”这个词在这里意味着什么呢？ 有些哲学家也许会告诉你 “好”这个词是一种表达你的情感的方式 或者，是鼓励你去做什么。 因此那个政客是在说 对于我的医疗计划 是在以一种祈使的形式告诉你 你应该支持我的医疗计划 但是 这并不是它所表达的全部 因为当某人说 哇 杜克 比方说，当我为杜克大学校队加油时，我说，好，杜克大学！ 首先，我并不是说杜克大学校队有多么强，我仅仅 我也许是在为杜克队加油 即使我知道他们并不是那么好 其次 你不可能问我为什么 当我为我的校队加油，“好，杜克大学！”，如果你回头问我，为什么好，杜克大学，这会很奇怪不是吗？ 如果你问为什么要 哇 杜克 这样的问句毫无道理可言 所以，通过说“好，杜克大学！”来表达自己情绪， 和评价杜克大学是一支很好的队伍是完全两回事 因而对于我的医疗方案说“哇” 与评价医疗政策方案会给我们的国家带来好处，是完全两回事 类似的 如果我说 我不喜欢鱼 因此我们晚餐不应该吃鱼 你看 我并不需要给你一个理由 我只要说我不喜欢鱼的味道，就是这样，没别的 

我并不需要向你解释为什么我不喜欢鱼 我就是不喜欢而已 但是 如果我说吃鱼是不道德的 吃鱼是错的 所以你不应该吃鱼 这就完全是另外一回事了 这个时候我就需要给你一个理由 如果我说吃鱼是不道德的 我就需要解释为什么吃鱼是不道德的 我需要吃鱼是不道德的一些理由 我不能凭空做出一个评价，而不给出任何理由来支持我的评价， 这样是不合理的 所以，在如上的例子中，我喜欢吃鱼，仅仅是一种表达，一种偏好。 跟做一个评价是完全不同的 一些东西好或者坏 对或者错 道德或者不道德 是完全不一样的 一种抓住评价性语言特点的方法是 将好这类词理解为符合标准 而将坏这类词理解为违反标准 当然这很空泛，因为它并没有告诉你什么是标准， 而且标准会随着不同的场景不断变化 比如你谈论一副好的油画 一幅好的油画的标准 与一个好的投资的标准就是不一样的 在这里投资的标准 与审美的角度毫无可比性。 

因此 如果我们认为好就是达到标准 比如说，当我们说一项医疗政策方案会给国家带来好处， 这就意味着，这项方案符合了使国家 在医疗方面运作良好的标准。 

然而如果我们说 吃鱼是不道德的 当我们说吃鱼是不道德的时候 我们其实是说吃鱼违反了某种标准 更准确的说是违反了某种道德标准。 所以我们才会用不道德这个词 通过如上的例子，我们可以看到这种评价性的语言往往可以通过判断事物是否符合或者违反标准的方式来理解。 然后 针对它为什么好或者不好 正确或者错误 道德或者不道德给出理由 我们就可以引用对应的标准来应用到具体的案例 从而来给为什么评价有效给出理由 但是现在 这里有一个花招 当我们说它好的时候我们并没有说标准是什么 而是根据语境来表达我们所说的是什么标准 这就很像我们之前学过的保证，当你说我向你保证，你可能会引用 一些权威或者说你有充分的理由， 却不把具体的理由说出来 而你在评价一些东西好的时候，你所说的仅仅是 但是却不把具体的标准说出来 因此 通过暗示标准的存在却又不把它们说出来 你就使你的说法更具防御性 因为，如果你摆出了你所指的具体标准 这些标准很可能会引起质疑 而你的观众就会知道 具体有哪些可以质疑的点和怎样反对你的观点。 但是 如果你简单的说 这很好 那么你所说的仅仅是，它符合了标准。 这样 你就可以避免异议 使你的前提更具防御性  评价性语言就是这样 避免无限回溯的 评价性语言还有另外一种用途 有的时候即使标准不同，我们依然可以在不同的标准上达成一致的意见 比如说，当你开着车，我说我们应该在这左转， 而你说 没错 我们应该在这左转。 当我说应该左转，我想的其实是， 左转那条路可以让我们更快地到达目的地 而你认为应该左转是因为， 左边那条路风景更好 你可以面朝大山 

但是我们都同意我们应该在这里左转 因为我们都同意左转符合标准 即使我的标准 越快达到目的地越好。 而你的标准是从审美的角度出发的，能看到越多的美景越好。 所以 你可以通过简单的说这个医疗计划对于国家 是有好处的来使更多的人同意你的观点 而不需要具体的说出这个医疗方案会带来怎样的好处 这样你就避免了人们就你的异议来争论 因为他们都会使用他们自己理解的标准来判断 这个医疗方案的好坏。 这就成了避免无限回溯的另一种方法 需要注意的是 评价性的语言会出现在很多不同层次上 有些词非常的抽象 比如好和坏 应该和不应该，对和错 

这些词可以被用在各种不同的场合 你可以有错误的投资 或者一个好的投资。 或者一个你应该做的投资。 你也可以在正确的道路上行驶 或者 在不好的道路上行驶 或者在不应该行驶的道路上行驶 因此 你可以有导航的标准或者经济的标准 都可以用这些非常通用的抽象的评价性词语来表达 比如，好坏，对错， 应该与不应该等等 然而其他评价性的词语在使用的时候就更有特定性 比方说，你可以说一幅画是美的或者丑的 

但你不能说化肥是美或者丑 你也不可能说股票是美的或丑的。 股票和化肥不能用 那样做的话 所以像美丑这样的评价性词语就更明确 它仅仅适用于小范围内 而像好坏这样的词语却适用于几乎所有的范围 来看另一个例子下面再举另一个例子 残忍或者勇敢，一个人可以是残忍或者勇敢的。 但是你不能说一幅画是残忍或者勇敢的 或者书桌是残忍或者勇敢的 或者椅子是残忍或者 勇敢的 椅子可能是舒适的 

但是画不可能是舒适的，士兵也不可能是舒适的。 士兵是勇敢或者不勇敢的 椅子是舒适或者不舒适的 但是椅子不会是勇敢的 士兵不会是舒适的 所以这些评价性的词语 比如勇敢和懦弱 美和丑 舒适和不舒适 仅适用在很有限的范围内 而不是适用于所有的东西  所以我们既有一般性的或者抽象的评价性词语， 我们也有一些更为特定的 具体的评价词语 当然，那些更为具体的评价性词语，其具体的程度也有所不同。 有些词就比其他词语更具体一些 这并不是绝对的二分法 但是有些评价性的词语 确实适用于几乎所有情况 而其他词语却只适用于一些有限的情形中 他们的不同在于他们适用的范围的不同。 你也许会问 为什么所有这些词语都是评价词呢？ 思考一下吧 如果你想要解释一些限制性的评价词 比如说美 你想要解释它的意思 这时候你就需要用一个更具一般性的词语来定义它， 蛮好的 如果你想表达“这很美” 你可以说就是某种看上去很好的意思 当然这不是非常精确，但是基本上来说，当你想要定义 美这个词的时候，你需要引用一个更具一般性的词语-好 然后引用使它“好”特定的环境 也就是说它看起来的情况下 再举一个例子，现在你要说一个跟经济学相关的词语，比如说特价， 特价意味着一个好的价格。 它以一个好的价格出售 而一个好的价格指的是低价 所以当你在定义特价的时候， 你就需要引用好这个词来定义 因此 这种一般性的评价词 与更为特定的评价词之间的关系就是 你需要通过一般性的评价词来 定义更为特定性的评价性词语 所以，当我们评价任何事物的时候 我们只需要在具体的语境下判断好与坏 对与错 是否有义务，是否应该去做等等。 而评价性语言最复杂的地方在于 评价是根据语境的不同而不断变化的 他们不是单纯地根据好坏对错 本身的含义来定义的 而是根据特定的语境来暗示 比方说，一个保守派的政客批评她的 说“他的政策过于自由主义了” 说他们自由主义 这算的上是一种批评吗？ 当然她的本意是进行批判，但是自由派这个词真的意味着不好吗？ 

答案是不一定， 她的对手也许会说 我为我是一个自由主义者而自豪 自由派是好的，没错，这很自由主义，那又怎样？！ 的确自由主义本身没有任何问题 自由派这个词本身并不意味着它是不好的，虽然说之前提到的 保守派人士会认为自由主义的东西是不好的。 严格来说自由主义这个词本身并不具备评价性 因为它不是单纯的通过好坏， 对错，应该或者不应该来定义的。 只有在一定的语境中 它才具备评价性 它是因为说话者预设的前提而暗示出的评价 而不是这个词本身有好坏的意味。 因为这样的不同 我们只有在 从字面上看就是评价性的，我们才会称之为评价性词语。 这样，它就可以通过好坏，对错这样的词语来定义， 而不仅仅是根据语境而产生评价性 对于说话者预设的前提 而暗示出的评价 如果他们没有直接的说 这是好的或者坏的 对的或者错的  那么他们所用的并不是我们称之为 评价性的语言形式  接下来我们再来看几个比较复杂的例子。 你可能会认为 把两个好的东西 放在一块，他们会变得更好。 而当你把一个不好的东西和一个好的东西放在一块，那个好的会变坏一些。 至少，通常情况下应该是这样。 但是我们来看看这个例子：当你说某些东西是好的时候，你认为它就好的 但是当你说 它挺好的，你在这个句子中加了个挺字， 挺本身应该意味着好 但是当你把这两个字放在一块，好加好并没有变得更好 甚至把好的程度的减弱了 当你把一个负面的词语放在中间 这真TM的好 这意味着非常好，也就是说，当你把一个 负面的词语，TMD，放在两个正面的词语中间 所得到的含义却是非常好  所以在做这样的组合的时候，我们应该仔细的思考一下 这样的词语组合到底是什么含义 这绝不是通过把好和不好做加加减减的简单公式 来得出这种语言的评价性。 还有一个值得注意的词语是“太”  

我喜欢辣的食物 所以当我说这个食物是辣的时候  

对于我来说 这是好的 至少不坏  说食物的是辣的对于我来说 我可能会喜欢它 但是 如果我在这个句子中加上一个太字  变成这个食物太辣了，这就意味着这是不好的。 太，这个小小的短语就这样把一个正面或者至少是中立的评价变成了一个负面的评价。 所以太这个词是一个负面评价性词语  因为它能够把中立或者正面的评价变得负面  因为太这个词会把事物的评价往负面的方向上拉， 所以它是一个负面的评价性词语  那么 使用评价性语言是不好的吗？ 有些人可能会认为我们不应该 去评价 而仅仅应该去描述 但这是不可能做到的 想象一下在生活中，完全不去评价好坏 和对错， 或者什么应该做或者不应该做。 你不会真的有一个不对任何观点做评价的生活 

因此去想评价不好是不对的 当然，当你评价的时候，你不能仅仅就说，好， 

你必须给出你认为它好的理由。 所以你应该想清楚你评价的标准是什么， 和为什么这个标准在这里是适用的 这个标准就是你评价事物好坏的理由  有的时候可能会很难想出 具体的适用的标准， 还有些时候，人们会下意识的评价事物的好坏， 而不想清楚他们判读的具体标准是什么。 所以 人们并不总能说出他们评价的标准 即使你追问他们  他们也可能还是 说出他们的评价标准究竟是什么  即使是这样，在你做出评价的时候好好想一想，为什么这个事情是好的或者坏的， 去想想为什么你认为 对于你自己来说总是一种 你适用的标准是什么？ 而当别人与你意见不一致时 询问一下他们的标准是什么 这样你就可以了解意见不一致的原因了 虽然说评价有的时候非常有效和合理的，但是同时有的时候它也可以很危险。 因为有些人会使用一些评价性的措辞却不给出对应的理由  我们把这称为妄下定论。 当你使用了一个评价性的词语， 而不给出任何使用这个词的理由，那么你就是在妄下定论  当你说别人是笨蛋或者怪胎 或者其他负面的评价的时候， 却不给出任何理由为什么你要用 为什么你要用 这么过分的词来形容别人  

如果你没有任何理由 这就是妄下定论  这往往是很不合理的。 在什么情况下，人们会妄下定论呢？ 他们这么做通常是因为其实他们想不出任何理由来支持他们的评价 如果你没有任何论据来支持你的评价 往往就会使用一些很过分的词语 比如说笨蛋  因此当人们开始使用类似于这样的语言  开始妄下定论， 那么这就是一个很好的提示  目前的论证可能是很无力的 他们通过使用这样的语言来 掩盖问题，蒙混过关 来掩盖他们的论据中的弱点。 所以我们可以通过一些评论性的词语来标记 论证中的弱点和有力论点。 到目前为止 我们已经学习了 论证标记 保证 让步  削弱以及评价这几种语言形式， 而在接下来几节课中， 我们将要学习一种一般性的技巧再来看看这些不同类型的语言 并用他们实战演练一下， 来分析一些报纸中的段落。 

但在这之前，我们先来做一些小练习， 来看看你是否已经理解了评价这种语言形式 【果壳教育无边界字幕组】 


## Close Analysis

### close analysis(part 1)

So far, we've looked at the language of argument in some detail. Because we've separated the reason markers from conclusion markers. And we've talked about assuring, and guarding, and discounting, and evaluative words. So we've picked out a lot of different words in language that play distinct roles in arguments. What we need to do for a real argument is to bring it all together and show how these types of words can work together in a single passage, and to do that we're going to learn a method called Close Analysis. And what you do with Close Analysis is you simply take a passage, and you mark the words in that passage that play those roles. So, a Reason Marker you can mark with an R, and a Conclusion Marker you can mark with a C, Assuring Term you mark with an A. a Guarding Term marked with G. A Discounting Term you mark with D. 

An Evaluative Term marked with E, and if it's clear you put a plus or a minus to indicate whether it's positive evaluation or negative evaluation. 

Now these marks will just be scratching the surface. There's obviously a lot more that you can do and need to do in order to fully understand the passage. So, when it's a Discounting Term you ought to think about which objection is being discounted. And you also ought to think about the rhetorical moves, the metaphors and irony. We'll look at rhetorical questions and we'll basically go through the passage very carefully word by word in order to figure out what's going on in that passage. 

So, how do you learn the technique? The answer is very simple. You practice and then you practice again, and then you practice, and practice, and practice, and practice. Practice won't make perfect because nothing's perfect. But practice will surely help a lot. And we'll get better and better the more we practice. So in this lecture, what we're going to do is go through one example in a lot of detail. And mark it up very carefully, in order to practice the method of close analysis. The particular example we chose for this lecture is by Robert Redford. It's an op-ed that was written for the Washington Post. We chose it because it's an interesting issue. It's about the environment. But it's not an issue that people will necessarily have very strong emotions about. Because you might not even know the particular part of the environment that he's talking about. 

We also chose it because it's a really good argument. You learn how to analyze arguments and how to formulate your own arguments by looking at good examples. Course it's fun to tear down bad examples, but we need a nice model of a good argument, in order to, see what's lacking, in the arguments that are bad. So we're going to go through an example, partly because, it's actually a pretty good argument. 

We're also going to go through this passage because it's really thick. With these argument words. So you'll see that we're marking a lot of different things and we'll have to go through it paragraph by paragraph, and sentence by sentence, and word by word, in great detail. This lecture will seem like it's looking at the passage with a microscope. and that's the point, to learn to analyze. With a microscope. The passages where people give arguments. Okay, so the first sentence says, just over a year ago President Clinton created the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument to protect once and for all some of Utah's extraordinary red rock canyon country. Word number one. Just. Well, justice is a good thing, right? So that must be an evaluative word. No. One of the first lessons in close analysis is that simply because you have the word just, doesn't mean you're talking about justice. When he says, just over a year ago, he means slightly over a year ago, or somewhat over a year ago, or sometime over a year ago. So maybe he's guarding, you might want to mark this one as a Guarding Term, by putting a g out there. But, he's not using an evaluation. To say, just over a year ago, well why would he guard? Because, he's not very precise. He's not going to say, 17 days over a year ago, he's saying, just over a year ago, so that nobody will raise a question at this point. He does not want people raising questions this early in the op-ed. So let's keep going. Just over a year ago, President Clinton created the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument to protect once and for all some of the extraordinary red rock country. Okay? What about the word, to? 

Might seem like not much, because it's such a short word. But, it's actually doing a lot of work there if you think about it. 

We actually, I think, should mark it as a, an Argument Marker of some sort. Is it a Reason Marker or is it a Conclusion Marker? We'll come back to that. But first let's get clear that it's an Argument Marker of some sort. 

When he says that he created the monument to protect once and for all, he means in order to protect because he wanted to protect once and for all some of that country. It's an explanation of why he created it. It's giving you the teleological explanation which tells you the purpose for which he created it. So the bit that comes out, protect once and for all some of the country, is the reason why he created it, that explains the conclusion that he did create it. So this is a Reason Marker. 

Now the next word, protect. Well you might think that, protect is a neutral word. Because after all, protectionism is criticized by some people. But actually to protect something is to keep it safe. To keep it safe from harm, to keep it safe from bad things happening to it. So to explain what counts as protection and what doesn't count as protection, you have to cite what's good or bad. And that makes it an evaluative word. And in this case, protecting is a good thing. So it gets marked as e plus. Okay, the next words are, once and for all. What does once and for all do? Nothing. Some of these words are going to get marked as nothing whatsoever. 

Because, once and for all doesn't guard, it says once and for all, it's the absolute limit. But the next word. Some and what does that do? That guards. 

It's saying that what's protected is not all of Utah's red rock country. It's only some of it. And it's important for him to guard that, because he wants to say later on as we'll see. But there's lots of it outside the monument that's not getting protected. So he wants to guard it and say it's not all that's going to be important to his argument. 

Now, Utah is pretty neutral, unless you're from that state, then you love it and you might say that's an evaluative word. But let's skip that group of people right now. Extraordinary, what about extraordinary? Is that an evaluative word? It might seem to be an evaluative word because clearly, what Redford means is extraordinarily beautiful or extraordinarily good red rock country. But the word extraordinary doesn't say extraordinarily good. 

You can have things that are extraordinarily bad. To say it's extraordinary is to say it's out of the ordinary and the red rock country might be extraordinarily ugly. So the word extraordinary itself is not by itself an evaluative word, so it should be marked as nothing. And red rock country. Also is going to be neutral. It's beautiful stuff, but simply describe it as made out of red rock. Doesn't say that it's beautiful, even though, we all know that it is. Just look at the picture. 

So, now we finished a whole sentence! Isn't that great? A whole sentence. Oh, wow. >>Wow! >>And all we did was find six things to mark in that sentence. Well, four were marked and two were nothing. But it shows you that you can go through a single sentence. Do a lot of analysis in order to figure out what's going on and we're just getting started. Now let's move on to the second sentence. It starts in response to plans of the Dutch company to mine coal. President Clinton used his authority to establish the new monument and so on. Let's go to end response to. What does that tell you? It tells you that what's coming after it explains why president Clinton used his authority. It was a response to the plans of the Dutch company. Which means that it's an explanation. Notice that the previous explanation says why Clinton wanted to do it in general. 

This explanation tells you why President Clinton did it at that particular time rather than earlier or later. It's because he was responding to particular plans by a particular company, so the end response to is an Argument Marker. Now, is it a Reason Marker or a Conclusion Marker? Well the conclusion, the thing that is getting explained is that Clinton used his authority. So, this must be a Reason, or a Premise Marker. You can also put P for Premise Marker, or R for Reason Marker. Now, in response to plans of the Dutch company Andalex to mine coal on the Kaiparowits Plateau. President Clinton used his authority under the Antiquities Act to establish the new monument. Now this is actually a pretty tricky one. We know that the plans of the company, are the premise that explains the conclusion that Clinton used his authority. But what's the word, under doing. Well, under means, it's the Antiquities Act that gave him that authority, that explains why he had the authority. And justified him in doing what he was doing. Namely, establishing the monument. So the word under suggests that there's another argument in the background here. That the Antiquities Act gives the President the authority to establish monuments, and President Clinton used that authority. So the Antiquities Act is again a premise or as I said you can call it a Reason Marker for. The premise that the Antiquities act gives the president that authority and that justifies Clinton in using his authority or explains why he was able to abolish the monument and the word to also indicates that. What comes after it is establishing the new monument. That's what he was trying to do. That also is an argument that explains why he did it. He had the authority, but you don't always exercise your authority, right? And so the point of exercising the authority, the real reason why he exercised his authority, was. To establish the new monument. Again, it might seem tricky to keep citing the word to as an argument marker, but think about it. You can substitute in order to. He used his authority in order to establish the new monument or because he wanted to establish the new monument. And we learned a few lectures ago, that if you can substitute another Argument Marker for this particular word, then that shows that in this case, the word to is getting used as an Argument Marker, in this case, the premise. Because it's his wanting to establish the monument that explains why he used his authority. Okay? And here's a tricky one. What about the word authority? Well that's a really tricky word and sometimes it's not completely clear. How do you want to mark it? Right? You might think that this word is getting used as a discounting word. Namely, answering a potential objection. Some people might say, he didn't have the authority to do that. 

But you might think it's a positive evaluation, having authority is a good thing. 

And you might think that it's an Argument Marker because it's a reason why he would have the ability to set up. The monument, namely that he had the authority, but it doesn't actually say, openly, any of those things. So I would probably mark that as a nothing, but I think it's better just to put a question mark, because sometimes words are not going to have one clear function or another. You know we're doing our best to put them into these little bins of the different types of words. But sometimes they're not going to fall neatly into one or the other and you just have to recognize that. Of course when it comes to the quizzes we're not going to ask you about those kinds of words. But it's worth knowing that they are there. Okay? Now, let's move on. Setting aside for protection. What he described as some of the most remarkable land in the world. Again, what is that telling you? Setting aside for protection. That tells you why he used his authority to establish the monument. So again, we've got an implicit reason here. But notice there's just a space, there's no actual word that can be marked as an Argument Marker. But still, there is a separate argument here. He set it aside for the protection, that was why he established the monument. That's why he used his authority to establish the monument, if you want to include that part of the argument, as well. 

Okay. For protection. Protection again. That's going to be evaluative, right? Because to protect something is to keep it safe from harm, harm is bad, so protecting it must be good. When you explain what protection is, you're going to need to use the words good and bad, as we saw in the first sentence. 

What about these little quotation marks? I love quotation marks. You gotta watch out for 'em. What he described as some of the most remarkable land in the world, why is Robert Redford quoting President Clinton and saying how Clinton described this land? 

Because if you're trying to convince Clinton, and trying to convince the general public to try to convince Clinton. There's nothing better than quoting Clinton himself. I mean, after all, Clinton can't say I'm not an authority. Right? So those quotation marks and saying that he described it. That all amounts to assuring. He's assuring Clinton that, that has to be true, because after all, you said it yourself. And then he says, I couldn't agree more. Well, that's a different type of assuring. Remember when we saw, that, some assuring terms were authoritative. And other assuring terms were reflexive. Where quoting President Clinton is an authoritative assurance, it's citing an authority. I couldn't agree more says how much he agrees, or how much certainty he has, it certainly suggests. And so he seems to be assuring you but on a different basis. Clinton and I both agree, we might disagree about other things, but we agree about this. Which gives you some reason to be sure that it must be true. Next for over two decades the word for is sometimes an Argument Marker. Is it an Argument Marker here? No, how can you tell that? It's actually nothing here, but how can you tell that? Try substituting an Argument Marker. You can't say, because over two decades, many have fought battle over battle. It's not because, it's just saying during that period. The term for and the words after it, over two decades. Are simply being used to indicate time, not to indicate any kind of reason in this case so it should be marked as nothing. 

Many have fought battle after battle, is that a guarding term? Sometimes many is a guarding term, instead of saying all you say many. But here you say many have fought battle after battle. Nobody thinks all have fought battle after battle to keep the mining conglomerates from despoiling the country. After all the mining conglomerates themselves didn't so it can't be all. So nobody would expect the word all so in this case the word many is not functioning to guard the term by weakening. because it never started out as this strong claim all. There was nothing to weaken. They fought battle after battle. Well you might think that battles are a bad thing. So you might mark that as E minus. Because after all, conflict is a bad thing, and in battles people get hurt and try to hurt each other. So to explain what a battle is, you need to introduce an evaluative word. And what do they fight those battles for? To keep mining conglomerates from despoiling the treasures, right? Again to, can be seen as in order to, that's why they fought the battle. It explains the battle. Or because they wanted to keep the mining conglomerates from despoiling the countries. So it looks like to there is indicating the premise in an argument that explains why they fought battle after battle. 

'Kay? Mining conglomerates, is mining bad? No? Are conglomerates bad? Not necessarily. You can explain what a conglomerate is without talking about good or bad. From despoiling. Wait a minute. Now we've got an evaluative term. It's an evaluative negative term. Despoiling means spoiling things, or making them bad, and what about treasures? Treasures. Is going to be an evaluative plus term, because treasures are good things. 

Now, the next word of the last sentence of this paragraph, just a temporal indicator, so that's nothing. We thought, okay, thought 

means it's not really true. He's just guarding it. It's not really true that some of it was safe. We thought is was. Some of it was safe or even at least some of it was safe. 

Now that's going to be a guarding term, because it's not saying it's not saying all of it was safe, it's just a little part of it and that'll become important later in the argument. Woah. Look at this diagram. It's got letters all over the place, and they're running into each other. That shows you what close analysis does. When you start looking in detail, a lot of the different words are doing things that you can find out by trying to put them into these different categories. So, we finished the first paragraph. An entire paragraph! Oh my God! [NOISE] >> Joy! 


到此为止 我们已经稍微详细地介绍了一些关于论证的术语 由于我们已将原因标记和结论标记分离开 并且讨论过保证性、 防卫性、削弱性和评价性的词汇  所以我们已经能辨认出 words in language that play distinct roles in arguments. What we need to do for a real argument is to bring it all together and 真正的论据需要将以上这些融会贯通 并且在单个段落中组合这些不同类型的词汇 为了做到这一点 我们将要学习一种名为严密分析的方法 严密分析需要在一个段落中 标记出上述的术语 所以 你可以用R表示原因标记 用C表示结论标记 用A表示保证性词汇 用G表示防卫性词汇 用D表示削弱性词汇 

用E表示评价性词汇 假如它是明确的 那么就用加号或减号来表示 它是积极评价或消极评价 

现在这些标记还仅仅是 隔靴挠痒 There's obviously a lot more that you can do and 显然你还能做更多 并且需要做更多来完全理解这个段落 所以 当遇到一个削弱性词汇 你应该 to think about which objection is being discounted. 同时也应思考反问、隐喻和讽刺的手法 我们要检视反问句 并逐字逐句仔细阅读段落 以找出这段话说明了什么 

So, how do you learn the technique? 如何学习这项技能？ 答案非常简单 练习 再练习 一直练习 Practice won't make perfect because nothing's perfect. 熟了不一定能生巧 因为事物不总是尽如人意 但练习总是有好处的 多多练习会让我们掌握得更好 所以在这节课中 我们将 用大量细节来阐释一个例子 And mark it up very carefully, in order to practice the method of close analysis. 通过仔细地标记来练习严密分析的方法 我们为这节课挑选的特定例子来自罗伯特·雷德福 这是一篇为华盛顿邮报撰写的专栏 我们选择这篇文章的原因是它是一篇很有意思的文章 它的主题是环境 但它并非 一篇人们必然会非常感兴趣的文章 因为你也许根本不了解 part of the environment that he's talking about. 

另一个选中它的原因是它的论证很棒 你要通过阅读好的例子来学会 如何分析论证以及如何组织你自己的论证 Course it's fun to tear down bad examples, but 拆解一个失败的论证很有趣 we need a nice model of a good argument, 但我们仍然需要一个成功的论证来做示范 为了检验失败的论证中缺失了什么 So we're going to go through an example, 我们将要琢磨一个例子 partly because, it's actually a pretty good argument. 

We're also going to go through this passage because it's really thick. 文章中密集使用了论证术语 With these argument words. 你将会看到我们做了大量不同的标记 并将以分解段落、 and sentence by sentence, and word by word, 观察入微的方式阅读 This lecture will seem like it's looking at the passage with a microscope. 这场讲座看上去像用显微镜在阅读文章 这就是学会如何分析的关键 要像用显微镜一样细致地分析那些使用论证的文章 Okay, so the first sentence says, just over a year ago President Clinton created the “仅仅一年前 克林顿总统建立了大升梯国家纪念区 Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument to protect once and for all some of Utah's extraordinary 第一个单词 “仅仅”（亦有公平之意） Just. Well, justice is a good thing, right? 正义是件好事 对吧 So that must be an evaluative word. No.  不 严密分析的首要规则之一就是 because you have the word just, doesn't mean you're talking about justice. When he says, just over a year ago, 当作者写道 仅仅一年前  他的意思是约莫一年前 或大致一年前  或是一年前的某个时间 So maybe he's guarding, you might want to mark this 也许他是在做保守性的估计 你可以标记为让步术语 one as a Guarding Term, by putting a g out there. 在这里写上一个G But, he's not using an evaluation. 但他并不是在做出评价  “仅仅一年前” 为何他要让步呢 Because, he's not very precise. 因为这个时间并不是精确的  他不是说 一年又十七天前 他说的是仅仅一年前 so that nobody will raise a question at this point. 所以没有人会对这个时间点提出疑问 He does not want people raising questions this early in the op-ed. 他不愿让人们在这篇社论对页版的开头就提出问题 So let's keep going我们继续看 Just over a year ago, President 建立了大升梯国家纪念区 to protect once and for all some of the extraordinary red rock country. 来一劳永逸地保护一些位于犹他州的特别红石峡谷地区” 对吗？  “来”这个词作何解释？ 

看上去并不十分重要 因为它是个短词 但如果你思考一下 实际上它在此起到了很大作用 

We actually, I think, should mark it as a, an Argument Marker of some sort. 我们应该标记它为某种论证术语 它是原因术语呢还是结论术语？ 我们等一下再回过头来看它 首先要搞清楚它是某种论证术语 

When he says that he created 当作者写道 总统建立了国家纪念区来一劳永逸地保护某些地区时 the monument to protect once and for all, he means in order to protect because he wanted to protect once and for all some of that country. It's an explanation of why he created it. 这句话解释了他为什么要建立纪念区  它是一种目的性的解释  告诉你建立国家纪念区的目的 接着出现的这一段 “一劳永逸地 保护某些地区” 即建立国家纪念区的原因 he created it, that explains the conclusion that he did create it. 它阐述了总统确实建立国家纪念区的结论 So this is a Reason Marker. 

Now the next word, protect. 下一个单词 “保护” Well you might think that, protect is a neutral word. 你可能会认为保护是个中性词  因为保护主义毕竟是被一些人批评的  但事实上保护某物是使它维持安全状态  使它远离危害 远离那些发生在它身上的坏事 要解释什么才算保护 什么不算 you have to cite what's good or bad. And that makes it an evaluative word. 你必须列举怎样算好 怎样算坏 所以“保护”是个评价术语 在此处 保护是件好事 So it gets marked as e plus. 所以要标记E+ Okay, the next words are, once and for all. 接下来是 “一劳永逸地” What does once and for all do? Nothing. Some of these words are going to get marked as nothing whatsoever. 有些词组是要被标记为无用的 

Because, once and for all doesn't guard, it 它有着绝对的限定 But the next word. 但下一个单词 Some and what does that do? That guards. “一些”这代表了什么？ 让步 

它说明了被保护的并不是所有犹他州的红石峡谷地区 只是其中的一部分 And it's important for him to guard that, because he wants to say later on as we'll see. 我们将在下文中看到他想说的话 But there's lots of it outside the monument that's not getting protected. 所以他使用了让步以说明并不是所有地区 not all that's going to be important to his argument. 

犹他州是个中性词 除非你来自那个州 you love it and you might say that's an evaluative word. 我们还是跳过那些人好了 “特别的”这个词是什么？ Is that 这是个评价术语吗？ 评价术语吗？ 它看上去像是个评价术语 因为显然 Redford想说的是特别美 或特别好的红石峡谷地区 但“特别的”这个词本身并不代表“特别好” 

“特别差”的事物也是存在的 To say it's extraordinary is to say it's out of 说一个东西“特别”意味着它不同寻常  红石峡谷地区也可能特别丑 So the word extraordinary 所以“特别的”这个词本身并不是评价术语 itself is not by itself an evaluative word, so it should be marked as nothing. And red rock country. Also is going to be neutral. “红石峡谷地区”也是中性的 It's beautiful stuff, but simply describe it as made out of red rock. 它是很美 但仅仅描述为由红石组成 并不代表它就是美的 尽管我们都知道它其实很美 Just look at the picture. 看一下照片 

现在我们完成了一句完整的句子！是不是很厉害？ A whole sentence. —完整的句子耶！哇！ Oh, wow. >>Wow! —哇！  我们刚刚做的是在这句句子中做了六处标记 Well, four were marked and two were nothing.  它显示了你能够通读一个句子 Do a lot of analysis in order to figure out what's going on and we're just getting started. 然而这仅仅是一个开头 Now let's move on to the second sentence. 接下来看第二句句子 它的开头是 “为回应荷兰公司的挖煤计划”  “克林顿总统运用他的权限来建立新的国家纪念区”等等 我们来看“为回应” What does that tell you? 它告诉了你什么？ It tells you that what's coming after 它表示接下来的句子将要说明克林顿总统运用权力的原因 将要说明克林顿总统运用权力的原因 这是对荷兰公司计划的回应 代表它是一种解释 请注意上一句中概括地解释了克林顿总统此举的原因 

This explanation tells you why President Clinton did it 这句话告诉你 克林顿总统为什么在这个特定时间做这件事 而不是其他时间 在这个特定时间做这件事 而不是其他时间 It's because he was responding to particular plans by 这是因为他在回应某个公司提出的某个计划 a particular company, so the in response to is an 所以“以回应”是一个论证术语 论证术语 Now, is it a Reason Marker or a Conclusion Marker? 那么它是原因术语还是结论术语呢？ 由于结论已经作出 即 克林顿运用他的权限 So, this must be a Reason, or a Premise Marker. 所以这一定是个原因或前提术语 你可以用P标记前提术语 或R标记原因术语 Now, in response to plans of the Dutch 为回应荷兰公司Andalex在Kaiparowits高原挖煤的计划 Andalex在Kaiparowits高原挖煤的计划 President Clinton used his authority under the Antiquities Act to establish the new monument. Now this is actually a pretty tricky one. 这是一个微妙的句子 We know that the plans of the company, are the 我们知道这个公司的计划是一项前提 从而得出克林顿运用他的权限的结论 But what's the word, under doing. Well, under means, it's the Antiquities Act 它的意思是古迹保存法赋予了他权限  赋予了他权限 从而解释了 why he had the authority. 并且为他的行为作出辩护 即建立国家纪念区 So the word under suggests that there's another argument in the background here. “根据”这个词暗示了这里有另一处论证 That the Antiquities Act gives the President the authority 即是古迹保存法给予了总统建立国家纪念区的权限 建立国家纪念区的权限 而克林顿总统运用了这项权限 So the Antiquities Act is again a premise or as I said you can call it a Reason Marker for.  它说明了古迹保存法赋予总统 权限 也解释了为何克林顿运用 此项权限以及有能力废除国家纪念区 “来”这个字也说明了 What comes after it is establishing the new monument. That's what he was trying to do. 这是他努力想要完成的 That also is an argument that explains why he did it. 这也是一个解释他为何这么做的论证 He had the authority, but you don't always exercise your authority, right? 他有权限 但人并非总是运用权限 对吧？  因此运用这项权限的意义 或真实原因在于建立国家纪念区 To establish the new monument. 这里再一次用到“来”作为论证术语  这看上去很狡猾 但想一想  You can substitute in order to. He used his authority in order to establish the 克林顿运用他的权限是为了建立新的国家纪念区 新的国家纪念区 或因为他想要建立新的国家纪念区 我们在几课前曾经学到如果你 能将某个词替换为其他论证术语 that shows that in this case, the word to is 这就表示这个词是一个论证术语 getting used as an Argument Marker, in this case, the premise. 在此处它表示前提 Because it's his wanting to establish the 建立新的国家纪念区是他的意愿 monument that explains why he used his authority. 这解释了他运用权限的原因 对吗？ And here's a tricky one. What about the word authority? 这里又出现了一个微妙的词 “权限”代表什么？ Well that's a really tricky word and sometimes it's not completely clear. 它很微妙是因为定义不清晰 How do you want to mark it? 你想要如何标记它？ 对么  也许你会认为它是削弱术语 就是说它在回应一个潜在的异议  有些人会说克林顿没有这样做的权限 

但也许你会认为它是一个积极评价 evaluation, having authority is a good thing. 拥有权限是一件好事 

And you might think that it's an Argument Marker because it's 也许你会认为它是一个论证术语 a reason why he would have the ability to set up. 是因为它是总统能够建立国家纪念区的原因 The monument, namely that he had the authority, but 即是他拥有权限 但文章中并没有公然说明这些 it doesn't actually say, openly, any of those things. So I would probably mark that as a nothing, but I think it's better just 所以我也许会标记它为无用 to put a question mark, because sometimes words are not going to have one clear function or another. 因为有时词语并不会有一个明确的功能 You know we're doing our best to put them 我们尽力把这些词归入不同种类 into these little bins of the different types of words.  但有时他们不会那么精准地 属于某一类或另一类 你需要做的事辨识出这些词 Of course when it comes to the quizzes we're 当然在测验中我们不会要求你分辨这类词 not going to ask you about those kinds of words. 但认识它们总归是好的 对吗？ Now, let's move on. Setting aside for protection. 现在我们继续看 What he described as some of the most remarkable land in the world. “把保护预留给他所说的世界上最非凡的土地之一” 这说明了什么？  “预留保护” That tells you why he used his authority to establish the monument.  我们再一次找到了一个内在的原因 But notice there's just a space, there's no actual word 请注意这里只是一个空格 没有任何单词可以被标记为论证术语 但这里仍然有一个单独的论证 He set it aside for the protection, that was why he established the monument. 他要为那些土地设置预留保护 因此他建立了国家保护区 That's why he used his authority to establish the monument, if 这就是他运用权限来建立国家保护区的原因 you want to include that part of the argument, as well. 如果你想把这部分算作论证也行 

好 “为了保护”这里又出现了保护 这是评价术语 对吧？ 因为保护某物是为了使它远离危害 危害是坏的  因此保护必然是好的 当你解释保护是什么时 you're going to need to use the words good and bad, as we saw in the first sentence. 你会用到表示好坏的词语 就像第一句中一样 

What about these little quotation marks? 这些引号是做什么用的？ 我特喜欢引号 你要小心它们 What he described as some of the most “他所说的世界上最非凡的土地之一” remarkable land in the world, why is Robert Redford 为什么Robert Redford要引用克林顿总统描述这片土地的话？ quoting President Clinton and saying how Clinton described this land? 

因为如果你想要使克林顿确信 以及 说服大众让克林顿确信 There's nothing better than quoting Clinton himself. 没有比直接引用克林顿的话更好的做法了 我的意思是毕竟克林顿不能说我不是一个权威 对么  所以这些引号以及引用的克林顿的描述 都是为了保证 He's assuring Clinton that, that has to be 他要让克林顿确保这一切都是真的 true, because after all, you said it yourself. 毕竟这话是他自己说的 And then he says, I couldn't agree more. 接着作者写道 我非常同意 这是另一种形式的保证 请记住我们会看到权威性的保证术语  还有一些其他反射性的保证术语 is an authoritative assurance, it's citing an authority. 引用克林顿总统发言就是一种权威性的保证 它直接引自权威 I couldn't agree more says how much he agrees, 或是暗示了他有多确定 因此他看上去在以另一种不同的理由使你确信  “克林顿和我都同意 我们可能在其他事情上意见不合 但在这一点上达成一致”  这给予了你某些相信它为真的理由 接下来是 “二十多年以来”  “以来”这个词有时会是论证术语 Is it an Argument Marker here? 在这里它是否为论证术语？ 不是 你怎么辨认出来？ It's actually nothing here, but how can you tell that? 它其实是无用的 但你要如何辨认？ 试着替换另一个论证术语 You can't say, because over two decades, many have fought battle over battle. 你不能说 “因为二十多年 许多人不断斗争” It's not because, it's just saying during that period. 这个词并不是“因为”的意思 它只是表明那个时间段  “以来”这个词 words after it, over two decades. Are simply being used to indicate time, not to indicate any kind of reason in this case so it should be marked as nothing. 

“许多人争执良久”这是一个让步术语吗？  有时候“许多”是让步术语 你会用“许多”来代替“所有” But here you say many have fought battle after battle. 但在这里你说“许多人争执良久” Nobody thinks all have fought battle after battle 没人会认为所有人会为了避免国家被采矿企业掠夺不断斗争 to keep the mining conglomerates from despoiling the country. After all the mining conglomerates themselves didn't so it can't be all. 毕竟采矿企业本身并没有那么做 所以不可能是所有人 因此没人会在这里想到“所有”这个词 the word many is not functioning to guard the term by weakening. “许多”并不是用来减弱语气以示让步的 because it never started out as this strong claim all. 因为此处并没有强烈断言“所有”的意思 There was nothing to weaken.没有任何对象需要被减弱 They fought “他们不断斗争” battle after battle.  你也许认为斗争是件坏事 So you might mark that as E minus. 所以你会考虑标记它为E- 毕竟冲突都是坏的 而且 在斗争中人们会受伤并伤害别人 So to explain what a battle is, you need to introduce an evaluative word. 为了说明斗争是什么 你需要引入一个评价性词语 And what do they fight those battles for? 他们为了什么而斗争？ To keep mining conglomerates from despoiling 为了避免财富被采矿企业掠夺 对吧？ the treasures, right?  “来”又出现了 它可以被视为“是为了”这就是他们斗争的原因 It explains the battle. 它解释了斗争的原因  或者说因为他们想要避免 财富被采矿企业掠夺 因此它看上去像是在暗示论证中的前提 这项前提解释了他们不断斗争的原因 

'Kay?  “采矿企业”采矿是坏事吗？不是？ Are conglomerates bad? 企业是坏的吗？ 不一定 You can explain what a conglomerate is without talking about good or bad. 你可以解释清楚一个企业是什么 而不用到与好坏有关的词 From despoiling. Wait a minute. “避免被掠夺” 等一下 现在我们找到了一个评价术语 It's an evaluative negative term. 它是一个消极评价的术语 Despoiling means spoiling things, or making them bad, and what about treasures? 掠夺意味着毁坏事物 或使它们变糟 那么“财富”呢 Treasures. 它会是一个积极评价的术语 因为财富都是好东西 Is going to be an evaluative plus term, because treasures are good things. 

Now, the next word of the last sentence of this paragraph, just a temporal indicator, so that's nothing. 它只是一个时间标志 所以是无用的 We thought, okay, thought “我们认为” “认为”说明它并不一定正确 

他在表示让步 It's not really true that some of it was safe. “有些是安全的”并不一定正确 只是我们这样认为 Some of it was safe or even at least some of it was safe. “有些”是安全的 甚至“至少”有些是安全的 

Now that's going to be a guarding term, because it's not saying all of 因为它并不是说所有都是安全的 it was safe, it's just a little part of 只是一小部分安全 这将在接下来的论证中至关重要 it and that'll become important later in the argument. Woah. 哇 Look at this diagram. It's got letters all over the place, and  它们都挤在了一起 这展示了严密分析是如何进行的 When you start looking in detail, a lot of the different words are doing 当你开始检视细节 things that you can find out by trying to put them into these different categories. 你可以通过归类不同词语来发现它们表示什么 我们已经看完第一段了 一整个段落！ 天哪！ [NOISE] 真开心！ 【果壳教育无边界字幕组】 

### close analysis(part 2)

On to the second paragraph. The first sentence is really simple, "Not so". Of course, it's referring back to the last sentence of the first paragraph, which said, now we thought at least some it was safe, and saying, no, it wasn't safe. So, what are we going to say about this sentence? Well, what about the wor- little word "so". 

So, can be an argument marker. It can indicate that what follows it, is a conclusion. But is that what it's doing here? I don't think so. 

As we just saw, like in, I don't think so, the word "so", can be used in many ways where it's not an argument marker, and this is saying it's not so. It's not that way. So there's no argument here, so that would get marked with a big N for nothing. Now, what about "shocking", as it sounds shocking. Well, is shocking always bad? Remember, we saw in the first paragraph, the word "stunning". 

Well, stunning stuns you, and shocking shocks you, and it's telling you that you have some kind of reaction, but it's not telling you whether that reaction is due to the thing being good, or the thing being bad. You can get shocked by something good or bad. It can be shockingly good, or shockingly bad. And so the word "shocking" by itself, doesn't indicate that it's E plus or E minus, so again, you get a nothing. I mention it only because, it's clear that Robert Redford thinks that "shocking" is bad, that this should not have happened. He's suggesting that it's bad, but the word "shocking" in itself is not an evaluative word. What about "as it sounds"? Well, he's saying that it sounds that way. He's not saying that it is that way. He's not saying that it may sound that way. He's saying that it does sound that way, which is to say, it seems that way to him. Which is not to say it really is true, so he's guarding the claim. 

He's not saying that it really is shocking. He's saying that it seems shocking, so he's guarding the claim, in order to avoid someone objecting that it's really not all that shocking after all. You say, well it sounds shocking. And in order to make that part of his argument more defensible, because it's not really essential to his argument that it's shocking or not. 

So it's supposed to be shocking. 

Clinton's Bureau of Land Management or BLM, has approved oil drilling within the monument. 

Notice, that there's no guarding at all here. He just states it. They did it. They approved oil drilling within the monument. And that's because it's not really something he's arguing for. He's actually opposed to it. It's something that his opponents might support, but he doesn't. So he doesn't want to guard it, since he wants to say it just happened as a matter a fact, that they approved it. So there's nothing that we need to mark in that particular sentence. Next sentence, BLM, or the Bureau of Land Management, has given Conoco Incorporated, a subsidiary of the corporate giant DuPont, permission to drill for oil and gas in the heart of the new monument. Well, there's a lot going on here that we could mention. You know BLM has given Conoco a subsidiary. That explains how they got permission, by siding the BLM. It's a subsidiary of the corporate giant DuPont. He's certainly suggesting that, "giant" suggested he's the small guy, you know, up against the big corporate giant. I-It might even have some connotation of corporate giants being bad, but it doesn't actually say that. And so again, "giant" should be marked as nothing. What about "permission"? To say that someone's permitted to do something, is to say that it's not wrong. That's what permitted means. Now of course, if you're talking about a legal permission? Then to say that it's permitted, is to say that's not legally wrong. It's not forbidded by law. It still might be morally wrong, but at least it's legally permitted; means it's not legally forbidden. And so if forbidden and wrong are evaluative words, to deny them and say it's not wrong, looks like an evaluative as well. But one of the interesting things about this evaluative word, is it's not clear whether it's positive or negative. It means it's not wrong, but that don't mean it is good or is right. It simply means it's not forbidden. So it's not clear whether to put plus or minus. So I'll just leave it as a plain E in that case, okay? Now, what did they have permission to do? To drill for oil and gas in the heart of the new monument, okay? That's what the permission was a permission to do. The word "to" there is not being used as an argument marker in this case, because you can't say, they get permission in order to, right? What they gave them permission to do, was to drill, okay? What about "drill"? Well, clearly Robert Redford doesn't want them to drill, so he thinks that's bad, but he donen't say that's bad. He just calls it "drilling". .And they're drilling for oil and gas. Well a lot of people think that oil and gas are good things, but they don't say here that they're good. They're simply saying that they're oil and gas. The coolest part of this sentence ,I think, is that metaphor at the end. I mean, you got this image that there's this, this, poor monument, and somebody's drilling right in it's heart. You know, like what could be crueler, than to drill in the heart of a young monument. The poor innocent thing. So this metaphor of the heart, is a nice rhetorical device, that fits with the drilling, and is building up people's opposition to what Redford wants them to be opposed to, but it doesn't actually give an argument. It's just stating it in a flowery or metaphorical way, that'll get their feelings going, okay? You may wonder, notice he doesn't say, you do wonder. He says, you may wonder. So this is, tell me? A guarding term, so you should mark it with G. You may wonder, as I do, "as" is sometimes used as an argument marker, but here you're not saying that you wonder because I do, or I wonder because you do. The word "because" can't be substituted for as. So to say "as I do," is simply to conjoin the two and say, you wonder and I also wonder or you may wonder, because I don't know whether you are or not, and I do. And what we wonder is, how can this happen? Now, we have a rhetorical question. How can this happen? Well, that's obviously suggesting, it shouldn't have happened. Now, how could something have gone so wrong, as it did in this case? But he doesn't actually say that. He simply asks the rhetorical questions, and that's really the trick of rhetorical questions. Notice there are a bunch of them here. Wasn't the whole purpose this? Didn't the president say he was doing this? Then these three sentences in a row, are all rhetorical questions. So what's the trick of rhetorical questions? The point of a rhetorical question, is to get you to give the answer. If I say, how can this happen? And someone thinks to themself, well the government messes up all the time. Then you've got that audience member who answered the question, to be saying it themselves. And there's nothing more forceful in an argument than to get your audience to say it themselves, when you don't have to say it. And that's the trick of a rhetorical question. And what Redford's doing here, is putting three of 'em right in a row, so that you'll have to go along with him three times in a row. And then, that obviously has an effect on your feeling, like you're with him, or you feeling like you agree with him. That's the effect he's trying to create by using these rhetorical questions. Okay, what's the whole purpose of creating? Notice, the whole purpose is to preserve. That phrase "the whole purpose," goes with it, because we say the purpose is to preserve. And there as before, in the previous paragraph, we're signaling an explanation, because if you want to explain why Clinton created the monument, then the answer was, to preserve the colorful cliffs and sweeping arches and so on. So, this is going to be an explanation, and to say, that's the purpose, is to say that, you created it because you wanted to preserve, or in order to preserve. Then this whole purpose, marks the conclusion, and the "to preserve" marks the premise. And we have a little argument. He wanted to preserve his colorful cliffs, therefore he created the monument. And we've got the conclusion marked by the whole purpose, and the premise, or the reason, marked by the word "to," okay? Preserve, we've already seen a word a lot like that, namely "protect". And we saw that when you protect something, it has to be good. Preserved also means, to preserve it against the things that would harm it. If harms bad, then preserving and protecting against harm must be good. So we can mark that as E plus. It's colorful cliffs, "colorful" sounds good, but of course colorful just means it's colorful. Sweeping arches, broad and sweeping in curves; well that sounds good. It sounds beautiful, the way he describes it. And it surely is, as you can see in any picture, 

but sweeping doesn't itself say its good or beautiful, or so on. Another "extraordinary"; we already saw extraordinary. So colorful, sweeping, and extraordinary, they're certainly being used here by Redford, to suggest that these are good, but they're not openly saying they're good. So we don't want to mark those as evaluative words. But resources, that resources are things that can give you abilities. When you have more resources, you are able to do more. So abilities sounds like a good thing, and resources are the things that make you more able. They give you more freedom and more power, so at least, many people would want to mark that as an E plus word. Some of these are going to be questionable. They're not as obvious as others, so I'm suggesting one way of interpreting this passage, and I hope you're following along? But if you have some questions about the particular cases, that's going to be natural. It's partly because our language is not totally precise, okay? Large scale mineral development; well that's not bad if it's done in the right places, so I don't think that's evaluative either. Didn't the president say that he was saving these lands? Well didn't the president say, that he was saving these lands? Well that suggests that he's assuring you, that in fact, he was saving these lands. 

He should know whether that's what he was doing, since after all, that's what he, you know, did himself, so he should be able to say what he did and why. Didn't the president say he was saving? Saving, could be marked as E plus just like protect and preserve, because it saves it from something bad happening; these lands from mining companies for our children and grandchildren. Now, what about the word "for"? This explains again, why he's saving these lands. He's saving them for our grandchildren and children. That means, the reason for saving these lands, is to benefit our grandchildren and children. So "for" is going to be a reason or a premise marker. It marks the reason or premise that justifies saving the lands, and explains why in fact the president did want to save the lands, okay? So now we're through with paragraph two and I hope you're kind of getting the feel for how to do close analysis. And so what I want to do now, is give you a chance to practice the skill on your own. We'll put up paragraph three. Mark certain words, and your task in the exercise will be, to put the right letter next to, or to indicate, the function of that word in the paragraph. And the letter you put, should be: either R or P for 

premise marker, C for conclusion marker, A for assuring, G for guarding, D for discounting, E plus/ E minus for positive and negative evaluation. And you can go through the third paragraph yourself, in the exercise. 

继续到第二段 第一句很简单 “不是这样” 当然它指向了第一段的最后一句 那句话说 现在我们 至少一些人认为它是安全的 但是说不　它并不安全 那么 我们怎么理解这句话呢？ “这样”这个词表示什么呢？ 

“这样”可以作为一个论证的标记 它可以暗示 在它之后的是一个结论 但这是这个词在这里的功能吗？我不这么认为 

就像我们刚刚看到的 比如在“我不这样认为”这句话里面 “这样”这个词 可以有非常多的不是用作论证标记的用途 “不是这样的”是在 表达“不是这个方式”的意思 因此 这里没有论述 所以这里可以用一个巨大的代表无的“N”来标记 “可怕的”这个词又如何呢？ 听上去确实很可怕 怎么样呢？ 可怕总是不好的吗？ 记住 我们在第一段里面看到 单词“令人眩晕的” 

“令人晕眩的”吓晕你 “可怕的”吓坏你 这是在告诉你 你有一些反应 但是没有告诉你 你的反应是否 由这些好事或坏事导致的 你可以因为一些好的或 坏的事情而吃惊 它可以是非常非常好或者非常非常坏的 因此“可怕的”这个词本身并不代表 它是E+或是E- 所以你再一次什么也没有得到 我仅仅提到了它是因为 我们可以很清楚地看到 罗伯特·雷德福 认为“可怕的”是不好的 这种情况不应该发生 他在暗示这是不好的 但是“可怕的“这个词 它本身并不是一个评价性的词语 “正如它听上去的那样”这个短语呢？ 他是在说 它听起来是那样的 他并没有在说它就是是那样的 他没有在说 它可能听上去是那样的 他是在说 它听上去确实是那样的 也就是说 对他来说是那样的 而不是在说 它就是那样的 他是在 对他的声明做让步处理 

他不是在说那真的很可怕 他是在说那好像很可怕 因此他是在对他的声明做让步处理 为了 避免有人反驳说那一点都不可怕 你说 它听起来很可怕 而且为了使得他的这部分论证更加不容易被反驳 因为是否可怕对于他的论证来说不是必须的 

所以它被假定为是可怕的

注意 这里完全没有让步 他仅仅是在陈述一个事实 他们的确做了这件事 他们同意了在国家遗址区内石油钻井 那是因为 这并不是他要论述的东西 事实上他是反对这件事的 这件事是 他的反对者们可能会支持的 但是他并不支持 所以他并不想为它让步 因此他想要说 这件事是已经发生了的事实 他们同意了在国家遗址区内钻井这件事 所以在这句话内我们并没有什么需要做标记的地方 下一句 BLM 或者说土地管理局 给了Conoco公司 企业巨头杜邦公司的 一个子公司 在新的国家遗址区的中心处钻井开采 石油和天然气的准许 在这里有许多我们可以注意到的地方 你知道BLM已经给了Conoco 一个子公司 这就解释了他们是怎样获得许可的——通过支持BLM 它是集团巨人杜邦公司的一个子公司 他肯定是在暗示 “巨头”意味着他 很渺小 你懂的 与企业巨头 相对抗的话 这句话里面甚至可能还有一些暗示企业巨头不好的含义 但事实上他并没有说出这些来 因此再一次地 “巨头”不应该被标记上什么 那么”许可“这个词呢？ 说某人许可做某件事 是在说做这件事没有错 这就是许可这个词的含义  当然 如果你是在谈论法律许可 然后说某件事是被允许的 既是说这是不违法的 它不是被法律禁止的 但它仍然可能在道德上是错误的 但是至少 在法律上是被允许的 这意味着它没有被法律所禁止 如果 ”被禁止“和”错误“是评价性的词语 那么否认它们  以及说它不是错的 看上去也是具有评价性的 但是关于评价性词语 有一件很有意思的事情是 它是正面的还是负面的这一点上是不清晰的 这个词意味着它不错 但是这不代表着它是好的或者它是对的 它仅仅意味着没有被禁止 因此　是放上加号还是减号这并不确定 因此我会只留一个E在这个例子上　OK? 现在 他们有了什么许可呢？ 在新的国家纪念区的中心开采石油和天然气钻井 对不对？ 这就是 许可之所以为许可要做的事情 ”去（做）“这个词在这里并不是当作一个论证标记来使用 因为你不可以说 他们获得许可为了 是不是？　  土地管理局给予他们许可去做的 是钻井 对吧? 那么“钻井”这个词呢？ 很显然地 罗伯特不希望他们钻井 因此 他认为这件事是坏事 但是他并没有说这是坏事 他仅仅称它“钻井” 他们钻井为了开采石油和天然气 好吧 很多人认为石油和天然气都是好东西 但他们在这里并不认为这些是好东西 他们只说那些是石油和天然气 这句话最棒的部分 是最后的隐喻 我的意思是 你会有这样一个画面 有一个可怜的国家遗址区 有人在它心脏的位置钻井 你知道 就像 有什么可以比在一个年轻的国家纪念区的心脏位置钻井更残忍的事情呢 这个可怜又无辜的小东西 所以这个心脏的音域 是一个非常好的修辞的工具 配合上钻井这个词 就建立起了人们对 雷德福想要他们反对的东西的反对 但是它并没有真正给出一个论证 它仅仅以一种华丽的或者是 隐喻的方式来陈述 这样可以让他们的情绪跟着走 明白否? 你可能会疑惑 注意到他并没有说 你确实会疑惑 他说的是 你可能疑惑 所以这是？ 告诉我 让步术语 所以你应该把它 标记上”G“ 你可能会疑惑 就像我一样 ”就像“这个词有时候也用作论证标记 但是 在这里你不会说 你疑惑是因为我疑惑 或者我疑惑是因为你疑惑 ”因为“这个词不能代替”就像“ 所以通过说”就像我一样“ 仅仅是把两者联系起来 然后说 你疑惑我也疑惑 或者 你可能疑惑 因为我不知道 你是否疑惑 并且同时我感到疑惑 我们所疑惑的是 这如何能发生呢？ 现在 我们有了一个反问句 这怎么可能会发生？ 好吧 它很明显地是在暗示 它不应该发生 在这里 某些事情是如何错得如此离谱 就像在这个例子里的一样？ 但是事实上他并没有这么说 他仅仅问了这个反问句  那正是这个反问句的花招所在 注意到文中有一大把的反问句存在 难道这不是所有的目的吗？ 难道总统没有说他在做这件事吗？ 这三个排成一排的句子 均为反问句 那么反问句的伎俩是什么呢？ 反问句的关键点在于 让你去给出答案 如果我说 这怎能发生呢？ 就会有人自己在内心想 政府一直都在搞砸事情 这样你就让那些回答了这个问题的听众们 自己说出了这句话 当你没有必要说某句话时 在论证中　没有什么比让你的听众自己把这句话说出来 在论证中没有什么可以比这更有说服力了 这就是反问句的手段 雷德福在这里做的事情 是把三个反问句排列在一起 这样你就必须连着三次跟着他的思路走 然后 很明显地 会对你的情绪造成影响 像你跟他是同一阵营一样 或者你感觉你同意他的话 这就是他使用这些反问句努力创造的效果 好 创建（国家遗址区）的全部目的是什么？ 注意 这个所有目的是去维护 ”所有目的“这个短语与其（”去“）伴随 因为我们说这个目的是维护 像之前一样 在上一段中 我们标记了一个解释 因为如果我们想解释为什么克林顿 创建了这个遗址区 答案就是保护 五彩的悬崖 绵亘的拱石 等等 所以 这将会是一个解释 通过说”那就是目的“来表达 你创建它是因为你想要去维护它 或者是 为了维护它 这个所有目的标明了结论 ”为了维护“标明了前提 我们有了一个小小的论证 他想要维护这些五彩的悬崖 所以他创建了纪念区 我们已经得到了被”所有目的“标记的结论  以及被”为了（保护）“标记的前提或理由 维护 我们已经见过很多这样的词语 比如说”保护“ 我们看到 当我们保护某些东西的时候 它必须是好的东西 维护也表示了 要维护某个东西 抵抗那些会破坏它的东西 如果破坏是不好的 那么维护和保护以对抗破坏就必须是好的 所以我们可以把它标上E+ 这是五彩的悬崖 ”五彩“听起来 就很好 但是当然五彩仅仅表示它是五颜六色的 绵亘的拱石 宽广的绵延的曲线 听起来就很好 他描述的方式听起来很美 这肯定是美的 像你在任何一幅画里能看到的那样 

但是绵延本身没有说它是好的或是美的 或者是别的什么 另一个 ”非凡的“ 我们已经看到了这个词 如此地华美、广阔、独特 它们 显然被雷德福用在了这里 用来暗示它们是好的 但是它们没有公然地宣称他们是好的 所以我们不想把它们标记成有评价性的词语 但是资源 资源是可以给予你 能力的东西 当你有了更多的资源 你就有能力做更多事 所以能力听起来像是个好东西 资源是让你有更多能力的东西 资源给你更多资源、更多力量 所以至少 很多人想要把它标记成E+词语 它们当中的有些会变得可疑 它们不像别的那样明显 所以我将建议解读这段话 的一个方式 我希望你们能跟着我一起 但是如果你对这个个例 有疑问 那也是很自然的 这部分是由于我们的语言并不是完全精确的 OK? 大规模的矿产开发 如果在适当的 地点完成 这不并坏 所以我也不认为这是具有评价性的 难道总统没有说过他在拯救这些土地吗？ 好吧 难道总统没有说过他在拯救这些土地吗？ 好 那 暗示他在向你保证 事实上他在挽救这些土地 

他应该之后那些是不是他在做的事情 因为毕竟那是他 他自己做过的事情 因此他应当能说出他做过什么以及做这些的原因 难道总统没有说过他在挽救（这些土地）吗？挽救 应当被标记为E+ 就像保护和维护一样 因为把它从 不好的事情中挽救回来 为我们的子孙把这些土地 从采矿公司手中（挽救回来） 现在 ”为了“这个词怎么样？ 这再一遍地解释了为什么他要拯救这些土地 他是为了我们的子孙而拯救它们 那以为着 拯救这些土地的理由 是造福 我们的子孙 因此”为了“这个词是一个理由或前提的标记 它标记了为拯救土地辩护的理由或前提 并且 解释了为什么其实总统是真的想要拯救这些土地 OK? 现在我们读通了第二段 我希望你们或多或少获得了 一些如何做仔细分析的感觉 所以现在我想要做的是 给你们一个自己锻炼这些技巧的机会 我们将放上第三段 标记出特定的词语 这个练习中你们的任务将是 在它们边上填上 正确的字母 或者点明那个词在这段话中的作用 你填上的字母应该是 R或P表示 

前提标记 C表示结论标记 A表示保证 G表示让步 D表示削弱标记 E+/E-表示正面和负面评价 你可以在练习中自己通读第三段 

### more close analysis

Welcome back. Now, you've done paragraph three yourselves and we're going to go on to paragraph four. It might seem like we're doing an awful lot of this but remember, the only way to learn close analysis is to practice, practice, practice, practice, practice. Over and over again, on as many passages as you can find. So, we're going to spend one more lecture going through paragraphs four and five of Robert Redford's piece in the Washington Post from 1997. The title was A Piece of God's Handiwork. Paragraph four starts, sounds like Washington double-speak to me. What is it that sounds like Washington double-speak to him? It's the sentence at the end of the previous paragraph that you analyze. And that's the claim that they issued the permit without a full review, using an abbreviated review, and they didn't even look at the leases on other federal lands. 

So, he's saying that sounds like the kind of thing Washington does, when they double speak. Double speak's obviously a metaphor, right? It's a metaphor for saying one thing to one person another thing to another person or sometimes saying one thing that seems to mean one thing when what they really mean is another thing. But however, you interpret the metaphor double speak, it's not good so we can indicate that double speaking is a negative evaluation. And it's a, a metaphor, but clearly negative in its meaning. You wouldn't say someone who's speaking properly is double-speak. Notice, however, that he has this phrase sounds like, and it sounds like it to him. What's sounds like doing? Well, he's not saying that it is Washington double-speak. So, he's guarding it, he's weakening the claim, he's not saying it is, he's saying it sounds like. And so that can be labeled as a guarding term. Okay. So, he's guarded that claim but now, he's going to go on and argue against the plan that Washington was using. 

I've spent considerable time on these extraordinary lands for years. I've spent, for years, let's just circle that whole thing to indicate that whole phrase. because it's all doing the same thing. What's it doing? It's assuring you. You see, because I have spent so much time on these lands, I spent so many years on them, you can trust me to know what's going on. I've got the evidence. Notice, like other assuring terms, it's not giving you the evidence. It's saying, you're to trust me because I've got the evidence. I've had the experience. So, it's a perfect example of assuring because it's saying that he has reasons without actually giving the reasons. And that's why you can't question his reasons because you haven't spent considerable time on those extraordinary lands. And of course, he follows that up with another assuring term he says, and I know, you say I know. That's an assuring term. A mental assuring term because it's describing the mental state as being one of knowledge. Knowledge implies truth and to say I know it is to imply that it's true to assure you that it's true, 'kay? And what does he know? He knows that an oil rig in their midst. Would have a major impact. Now, what about that a major impact, okay? Now, 

he's clearly saying it would be a bad impact but does he come out an say it's bad no he just says it's major, okay? So, it's not evaluative term that would be labeled as nothing if nothing is an option. So, clearly suggesting that it's bad but he's not saying it. So it shouldn't be marked as an evaluative term, okay? Next, what's more? Well, what's more is kind of a conjunction. But what came before this was an argument that it would have a major impact based on his assurance. And so when he says, what's more, he's suggesting that what's going to come next is yet another argument for why we shouldn't have these, these permits issue. He's going to tell you other bad things about them. So, that can be a premise marker because what comes after it is the premise. 

They want to drill to find oil. Well, we can say to find oil, it's in order to find oil that is going to explain why they want to drill. It's a teleological explanation as we saw in an earlier lecture. And so that is going to be a reason marker because their desire to find oil Is what explains their desire to want to drill, okay? Inevitability. What's that? Assuring. It's assuring you that it's obviously true. There's no way around it. It is inevitable. What's inevitable? More rigs, more roads, new pipelines, toxic wastes and bright lights would follow to get the oil out, okay? He's assuring you, that all of those things are going to happen. The previous argument before the what's more was simply an oil rig. Notice it's just an oil rig, one oil rig up there in that sentence. But now we've got more rigs, more roads, new pipelines. So, if an oil rig has a major impact, all of this other stuff's going to have a lot more of an impact. That's the point of the what's more. He's adding additional reasons why the permits should not be issued, 'kay? And they would follow. That means it's going to follow, what? In time. It's just temporal. It's not saying, anything more than it's going to follow at a later time but they're going to follow, to get the oil out. That explains why they would follow because, right? You would need them in order to get the oil out. So, that's going to be an argument marker itself. Is it a reason marker or is it a conclusion marker? Well, the conclusion is that all that's going to follow, right? And the premise is that it's needed in order to get the oil out. So, this is going to be a premise marker. 

And the conclusion is that you get all that stuff, the pipelines the roads the waste and so on, okay? So those are his reasons against giving a permit. And then he says the BLM couldn't see this, okay? Just states it as a fact, but. What's the but doing there? Remember what kind of word a but is? But is a discounting term. He's answering an objection. The objection is, well, you say all that would follow but the BLM would disagree with you and they looked at it very carefully and they're an authority or an expert. So, the answer to that objection is, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Environmental Protection Agency, did see this. Notice that what comes after the but is more important than what came before it. What he's doing is saying that there's a contrast between what the BLM couldn't see and what the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Environmental Protection Agency did see. But in addition to the contrast between those two he's also saying it's more important that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Environmental Protection Agency did see it, okay? So, what comes after the but is taken to be more important. 

And what did they see? Both of these agencies recognized, recognize implies you can't recognize things that aren't true. You know, if you see somebody and you'd say I recognize my sister and it wasn't your sister. You didn't really recognize them. So, to say you recognize is to assure people that it's really true. The devastating, now devastating can't be good so that's e minus. 

Effects of extensive oil drilling. Extensive is that bad? No, extensive oil drilling's good in the right places. Gives us the kind of energy we need to be able to accomplish the goals that we want. Maybe you'd wish you didn't need extensive oil drilling. But, if you need it, then it's good, when it's done in the right place. And that drilling would have a, devastating effects on this area. And then those two agencies urged the BLM to refuse to allow it, okay? Why? In order to protect the monument. And again, we've seen this kind of argument repeatedly at several points during this particular op-ed. That's saying that the goal is to protect the monument and that's what justifies urging the BLM to refuse to allow it. So this is going to be a premise marker. We've seen an order to protect, an order to preserve because we want to protect and so on. He keeps repeating that. That's not a bad thing. Many times when someone's giving an argument, they repeat pretty much the same words as in other areas because they're giving several arguments for a single conclusion. We'll actually see how those different reasons can fit together in the next section of the course, but for now all we're doing is marking the words in an order to, as a premise marker. We finished four paragraphs! Alright! We're almost done! Yes! Now, we're on to paragraph five, and it starts, maybe the problem comes from giving management responsibility for this monument to the BLM. What about the word, maybe? The word maybe is about as clear a case as you can get of a guarding term. It's saying, it might be the case, it might not be the case, I'm not going to definitely claim that's where the problem comes from. I'm just suggesting that maybe so somebody comes along and says, that's not really true. I, I'm going to say, well, j, maybe it's true. It's all I was claiming. And so I'm now able to defend my premise, okay? Problem, what about problem? 

Gotta be e minus, right? Another clear example, because you can't have good things, if there are problems. Sure you can have problems on math tests that are good but that's not the kind of problem we're talking about here. These kinds of problems are bad and so that word gets marked as e minus. 

So, the problem comes from namely, is explained by giving management responsibility for this monument to the BLM. So comes from can get marked as a premise marker. It's the giving management responsibility to the BLM that explains why there's a problem in the first place. And that could be put in the form of an argument, that explanation could. 

Okay. So, why is giving management responsibility to the BLM create a problem? Because the next sentence tells you this is the BLM's first national monument, the first time they've ever done this. Almost all the other monuments are managed by the National Park Service, okay? Nothing wrong in itself with being the first. There always has to be a first. So there's nothing evaluative there. What about almost all? Clearly guarding, right? Because it's not all, it's almost all. So the claim is more defensible. 

Almost all the others are managed by the National Park Service. 

The park service's mission is to protect the resources under its care, okay? Protect good, resources good. So those both get e plus. While, what about the word while? It's not completely clear. You could read this as simply setting up a contrast between the park services mission and the bureau's mission. But you could also read it as responding to an objection. Well, doesn't the government protect those resources? And the answer is well, the park service does but the bureau has a different role. The bureau has always sought to accommodate economic uses, okay? So, if you read that while as but and you replace it with but it seems to make sense. The Park Service's mission is to protect, but the bureau has always, it looks like you can replace it with the discounting term, which means that while is functioning here as a discounting term, okay? The bureau has always saw it, no guardian there, it's always sought that, right? To accommodate economic uses of those resources under it's care. 

Even so, starts the next sentence, what is even so doing? Well, even so, is a discounting term because it's discounting an objection. 

The objection is, well, they've always sought to accommodate those uses, well, then how do you explain the fact that they got off to such a good start? They seem to be, okay? They seemed to be. That's a guarding term. It's not saying they were. It's saying they seemed to be getting off to a good start. Good, boy there's an evaluative plus. You can't beat that for a clear evaluative plus. To a good start by enlisting broad public involvement in developing a management plan for the area. Well, what was good about it? They enlisted broad public involvement. Therefore, it was good. Looks like by enlisting could be a premise marker. The premise is, enlist, they enlisted broad public involvement. Therefore, they got off to a good start. Yet. Whats yet? Another discounting term. The agency's decision to allow oil drilling in the monument completely undercuts this process just as it is beginning. The objection is, so if they go off to a good start whats the problem if they listed broad public involvement, whats the problem? 

Well, that's the objection and the response is now they've decided to allow drilling in the monument. And that completely undercuts the process that did enlist public involvement, right? So, the yet is just counting the objection that says there's no problem here, they're doin just fine, they've got broad public involvement. They're saying the response to that objection is but now they have not got public involvement. They're doing it without a complete review and so on is mentioned in the preceding paragraph. 

The agency's decision to allow oil drilling in the monument completely no guarding, right? Completely undercuts when it's that strong a word like completely, you can almost say it's I'm assuring you it's not just partially undercutting, it's completely undercutting. That's a way of, of making you confident that it really does, at least partially, undercut the process. And undercuts sounds like something bad. I suppose you might not want to mark it as evaluative because, you know, you could undercut a bad process and that would be a good thing. So, literally you probably should not mark that as evaluative, but it's clear what Robert Redford thinks about undercutting this process. And now just. Just stands for justice, doesn't it? No, remember from the very first word of this op-ed. Just is nothing here. It means at the same time when it was beginning. It's not an evaluative term, even though just sometimes means something about being just or fair or good, here it doesn't mean that at all. So, we're back to the very word that we began this op-ed with and so that seems like a good place to stop. I'll stop marking here. There are other things you could mark, there are others things to discuss. These paragraphs, these op-eds are always extremely complex and interesting to try to get the details straight. But I'll give you a chance to look at the next three paragraphs. They're all pretty short. Look at those paragraphs and see if you can do a close analysis on those. Because as I've emphasized several times, the best, indeed the only way to learn close analysis is to practice, practice, practice, practice, practice. 

欢迎回来 现在你们已经自己完成了第三段 我们将要继续到第四段 看起来我们像是一直做着这繁重又无趣的工作 但是记住 学习 详细分析的唯一方法是 练习 练习 练习 练习 再练习 一遍又一遍地 尽可能多地找文章来练习 所以 我们将要再花一节课的时间来 通读罗伯特·雷德福(Robert Redford)1997年发表在 《华盛顿邮报》(Washington Post)上的文章的第四、五段 标题是 上帝之作 第四段的开头是 对我来说 听起来像华盛顿官腔（译者注：华盛顿意为美国政府） 什么对他来说听起来像是华盛顿官腔？ 是你们分析过的上一段中的 最后一句话 就是 他们没有进行充分调查 而是简略地 考察 就签发了许可证 甚至都没有 参考联邦土地的其他租约 这一声明 

所以他说这听起来像是 政府(Washington)会说的话 就是当他们打官腔 的时候 打官腔很显然是一个暗喻 是吧？ 暗喻就是对于一个人来说是一个东西 对于另一个人 是另一个东西 有时候说的某个东西 的意思 应该是这个东西 但是它实际上的表示的 又是另外一个东西 然而 当你理解“打官腔”这个 暗喻时 这听起来并不好 可以表示“打官腔”是一个 消极的评估 这是一个暗喻 但是很清楚的 它的意思是消极的 你不会说一个正常说话的人 是在“打官腔” 要注意 这里有"听起来像"这个短语 这对于他来说听起来像是这样 “像是这样”在这里起什么作用？ 嗯 他并不是说这就是 华盛顿官腔 所以 他是在让步 他削弱了 这个声明 他并不是说这就是 而是说这听起来 像 所以这可以被标记为一个 让步词 好 所以 他让步处理了他的声明 但是现在他要继续他的 论证 反对政府(Wahsington)正实行 的计划 

我在这些极佳的土地上 花了相当多的时间（研究） 我用了好几年 让我们把这整个 圈起来 标示这整个短语 因为这整个起同一个作用 它起什么作用呢？ 它是在向你保证 你看 因为我花了很长的时间 在这些土地上 我花了 这么多年在这上面 你可以相信我说的 发生的事情 我有证据 注意 像其他的保证词一样 它 并没有提供给你证据 它表示的是 你应该相信我因为 我有证据 我有经历 所以 这是 保证 的一个极好的例子 因为它 的作用是 指明了我有理由 但是又不真正地给出理由 这也是为什么你不能质疑他的 论证 因为 你并没有在这些极佳的土地上 花大量时间 当然 紧跟着就是另外一个 保证词 他说 我知道 你说我知道 这是一个保证词 这是一个精神上的保证词 因为它 描述的是 获取一种知识这一精神 状态 知识暗示着真相 说我知道这个 就是 暗示这是真的 来使你确信这是真的 懂了吗？ 那么他知道什么呢？ 他知道在这块地中央建石油钻塔 会有极大的影响 现在 什么是 极大的影响 想一想？ 

他很清楚的表示这会有非常恶劣的 影响 但是他明说 这会有非常恶劣的影响了吗？他说的是 这会有极大的影响 所以 这不是一个评估词 如果没有 任何选择的话可以什么都不标记 所以 这是非常清楚地暗示这很不好 但是 他又没有明说 所以这不可以被标记成一个评估 词 好吗？ 接下来 除此之外 嗯 “除此之外”是一种 连接词 但是在这之前的是一个论证 就是基于他所保证的来看 会有一个极大的影响 所以 当他说 “除此之外” 他是 暗示接下来 要说的是另一个我们为什么 不能签发许可证 的论证 他将要和你阐明这会造成的另外的 不好的影响 所以 这可以是一个前提标记 因为 在它之后的 是一个前提 

他们想要钻井来开采石油 嗯 我们可以说找到石油 为了 找到 石油 能够解释为什么他们想要 钻井 像我们在之前的一节课里讲的那样 这是 一个技术性的解释 所以这将成为一个原因标记 因为他们开采 想要开采石油 是能够解释他们 想要钻井的 是吧？ 不可避免地 这是什么？ 保证 这是在向你保证这显而易见 是正确的 这个没法避免这个没法避免 这是不可避免的 什么是不可避免的？ 更多的钻井 更多的道路 新的管道 有毒废物 还有光污染 都会伴随着石油开采而产生 对吧？ 他是在向你 保证 所有的这些事情都是会 发生的 在“除此之外”之前的论证 仅仅只是一个石油钻塔 注意这仅仅是一个石油钻塔 在那个 句子中只有一个石油钻塔 但是现在 我们有更多的钻塔 更多的道路 新的管道 所以 如果一个石油钻塔会有极大的影响 那么所有 这些其他的东西 会产生大得多的 影响 这就是“除此之外”的作用 他是加上了 为什么许可证不能被签发 的 另一个原因 对吧？ 这是接下来会发生的 这就表示他们将会发生 什么意思呢？ 在时间程度上 这仅仅是暂时的 这并不是说 所有更加不好的事情 在之后的时间里 都会跟着发生 但是他们会因为石油的开采 而接着发生 这解释了他们为什么会接着发生 对吧？ 因为为了开采石油 你将需要这些 所有的东西 所以 这本身就可以是一个论证标记 它是一个原因标记还是一个 结论标记呢？ 嗯 它之后的全部都是结论 是吧? 前提就是这些都是石油开采所必须的 东西 所以 这是一个前提标记 

这里的结论是 你得到所有 这些东西 管道 道路 废物 还有 很多 对吧？ 所以这些是他反对签发许可证 的原因 他也说了BLM（土地管理局）没有 考虑这个 对吧？ 仅仅只是把这个列为一个事实 但是 “但是”在这里是什么作用呢？ 记得“但是”是哪一种词吗？ “但是”是一个削弱词 这是在呼应一个相对物 这个相对物是 嗯 你可以说所有这些都会伴随而来 但是BLM不会同意 他们仔仔细细地看过了 并且他们 是权威 或者专家 所以 呼应这个相对物的是 美国 和环境保护署 环境保护署 确实考虑到了这个 注意这之后会发生的事情 远远比 这之前的更重要 它说明的是那确实会有 BLM没有看到这一点 和 美国 及环境保护署考虑到了的事 做了一个对比 但是除了这个两者的对比 之外 他也表示美国渔业及野生动物 服务 和环境保护署 考虑到这一点更重要 对吧？ 所以 在“但是”之后的句子 更为重要 

他们考虑到了什么？ 这两个机构都意识到 暗示着 他们意识到的东西不可能不是 真的 你懂的 如果你看见某人 你会说 我能认出那是我的妹妹而不是 你的 你并不一定能认出他们 所以 说你能意识到 就是向 别人保证 那真的是真的 这毁灭性的 现在 “毁灭性的”不能 褒义的 所以它是e- 

大规模的石油开采的影响 大规模有那么不好吗？ 不是这样的 在对的地方大规模的开采 是很好的 能够给我们提供能源 使我们有能力 达到我么想要达到的目标 可能你希望你不需要大规模的 石油开采 但是 如果你需要 不且在正确的地方实行的时候 那就是极好的 开采会对这块区域 产生毁灭性的影响 接着这两个机构强烈要求BLM 拒绝这个开采 是吧？ 为什么呢？ 为了保护这里的自然杰作 再一次的 我们见到了这样的论证 在这个专栏里重复了 好几个点 这是说明目的是 保护 自然杰作 这也是说明强烈要求 BLM拒绝 开采的原因 所以这将是一个前提标记 我们遇见了 保护的请求 保留的 请求 因为我们想要保护它或者 之类的 他一直重复这一点 这并不是一件不好的事情 当一个人发表论证的时候 对于同一个点 他总是 重复相当多遍 不过换几个词 因为他们再给 一个结论 不同的论证 我们将会在下一部分的课程中 了解 这些不同的原因是怎么结合在一起的 但是现在我们 做的就是标记这些词 比如说 是一个前提标记 我们完成了第四段! 好啦！ 我们基本上做完了！ 太棒了！ 现在 我们继续到第五段 它的 开始是 可能 问题来源于把这块自然杰作的 管理责任交给 BLM 这个词是什么意思呢 “可能”？ 非常清楚地 “可能”这个词的语境一下就能 被猜到这是一个让步词 它的意思是 可能是这样的 也可能不是 这样 我不会肯定的说这就是这个 问题产生的原因 我只是建议那可能是这样 有人 也可以过来然后说这根本就不是 事实 我 我要说的是 嗯 这可能 是真的 这就是我声明的全部 所以现在我 就能够辩护我的前提 是啊吧？ “问题” 问题又任何呢？ 

这该是E- 对吧？ 这是另外一个很好的例子 因为如果有问题的话 你就得不到好的结果 当然你可以说数学考试时的问题 是很好的问题 问题 但是不是我们这里 说的这种 这些问题是不好的 所以这个词可以被 标记成 e- 

所以 这问题的来源 也就是可以 被解释为 把这块自然杰作的管理责任 交给了BLM 所以“来源”可以被标记为一个前提 标记 是 把管理责任交给 BLM 解释了为什么这会首先 出现问题 这可以被放到论证的格式中 就是 这个解释 

好 所以 为什么把管理责任 交给BLM会产生问题呢 因为下个句子告诉你 这是BLM的 第一个国家自然保护区 这是他们第一次 管理这样的土地 其他几乎所有的保护区都是受国家公园管理局 (National Park Service)管理的 好吗？ 第一次管理本身并没有错 总是会有第一次 的 所以这里并没有 评估 “几乎所有”又是什么词呢？ 显而易见 让步 对吧？ 因为它不表示全部 而是几乎全部 所以这个声明是更加牢固的 

几乎其他所有的（自然保护区）受国家 公园管理局管理 

公园管理局的任务是 在它的关怀下 保护资源 是吧？ 保护是好的 资源也是好的 所以这两个 都是E+ 然而 “然而”又什么作用呢？ 这并不是非常清楚 你可以就简单地认为 这建立了 公园管理局的任务 和 BLM的人物 之间的对比 但是你也可以认为这是在回应 一个相对物 嗯 难道政府没有保护这些 资源吗？ 答案是 公园保护局确实是有这个任务的 但是BLM没有 BLM总是想法子要 多赚钱 是吧？ 所以 如果如果你把“然而”读成“但是” 你把它替换成但是 似乎也 说得通 公园管理局的任务是保护 但是BLM总是 “总是”这个词 看起来你可以把它换成一个 削弱词 意思是 这个 while是 作为一个削弱词在起作用的 对吧？ BLM总是看见这个 并没有让步 总是想着这个 对吧？ 来在它的努力下 利用这些资源 寻求更多的经济用途 

即使是这样 是下一句的开头 这里 ”即使是这样“起什么作用呢？ 嗯 ”即使是这样“是一个削弱词 因为它是在削弱一个对应物 

这个对应物就是 嗯 他们总是 想着法子 来开发经济用途 嗯 那么怎样 来解释他们获得了这么好的 一个开始？ 他们就好像是 对吧？ ”他们就好像是“ 这是一个让步词 并不是说他们就是 而是说他们好像是 有一个好的开始 好的 同学们这是一个E+ 毫无疑问的 这肯定是一个 E+ 一个好的开头通过获得足够多的 公众投入来发展这块区域 的管理 嗯 这又有什么好的呢？ 他们获得了广泛的公众投入 因此 这是很好的 看起来 ”通过获得“可以作为一个前提 标记 这个前提是 ”获得“ 他们获得了 广泛的公众投入 因此 他们有一个好的开头 但是 ”但是“又是什么？ 另外一个削弱词 这个机构的决定 允许在这个保护区里 进行石油开采 大大削减了其中的步 就像它刚刚开始一样 这里的对应物是 所以如果他们有一个 好的开始 问题是什么？ 如果他们获得了广泛的公众投入 问题是什么？ 

嗯 这就是那个对应物 那么回应是 现在他们们决定了允许在这块保护区内 钻井开采 这回大大削减获得 公众投入的步骤 是吧？ 所以 这个”但是“就是重申这个 表明没有任何问题 一切都好 他们获得了广泛的公共投入 这个对应物 他们说明的对于这个对应物的 回应是 现在他们不能得到公共 投入了 他们做这件事的时候并没有进行充分的调查 还有 之类的事 这些在前一段中提到 过 

这个机构的决定 允许在在这个 自然保护区 钻井开采 这完全没有让步 对吧？ 大大削弱 看到像”大大“这么语气强烈 的词 你就几乎可以肯定这是在 向你保证 这并不是只有一点点的削弱 而是大大削弱 这是使你完全 相信 这确实是这样的方法 至少有这么点作用 削减了这些步骤 削减 听起来像是不好的事情 我觉得你们可能不想把它标记为一个 评估性的词 因为你懂的 你可以削减一个不好的步骤 因而这就是一个 好的事情 所以 字面上来说 你可能是要把它标记为 一个评价性的词 但是 罗伯特·雷德福对于削减步骤的想法是 很清楚的 现在 ”仅仅“ ”仅仅“意思是给出理由 是吧？ 不 记住这个专栏最前面的 第一个词 仅仅 在这里并不表示任何意思 它的意思是 当开始 的时候 它并不是一个评估性的词 即使 有些时候 "公正的”表示“公平的”或者“好的” 在这里它并不表示这任何一种意思 所以 我们又回到 专栏开头的词了 这该是一个很好地结束的方式 我们就在这里结束标记把 还有很多其他的可以标记的 也有很多值得讨论的 这些段落 这些专栏文章总是 非常复杂 却有趣 当你来把他们所有的细节 理清 但是我将要给你们一个机会来 思考 接下来三段 它们都很短 思考这三段 看看 你自己能不能自己完成它们的详细分析 因为我已经强调过很多遍了 最好的 确实也是唯一的方法 来更深入地学习详细分析 是练习 练习 练习 练习 再练习
