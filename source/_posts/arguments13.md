# How to Reconstruct an Argument

CONTENT: This week’s material will teach you how to organize the parts of an argument in order to show how they fit into a structure of reasoning. The goal is to make the argument look as good as possible so that you can learn from it. We work through the main steps of reconstruction, including putting the premises and conclusion into a standard form, clarifying the premises and breaking them into parts, arranging the argument into stages or sub-arguments, adding suppressed premises where needed to make the argument valid, and assessing the argument for soundness. The lectures begin by defining the crucial notions of validity, soundness, and standard form. You will also learn to diagram alternative argument structures, including linear, branching, and joint structures.

LEARNING OUTCOMES: By the end of this week’s material, you will be able to:

label assuring, guarding, discounting, and evaluative terms
determine whether an argument is valid or sound
complete arguments by adding suppressed premises
reconstruct arguments by and series of arguments
classify argument structures

## Validity and Soundess

### validate

Welcome to Week Three. In weeks one and two, we already learned a lot about how to identify and analyze arguments. 
0:11
We can do close analysis, we can identify the premises and conclusions, we can put them in standard form, what's next? Well, the next step is to take those parts and put them in a certain order and fill in the missing gaps. We need to learn how to reconstruct arguments. Are you ready? Well there are lots of way to reconstruct. Think about constructing a house, or building. 

In order to construct a good building, you got to know what the goal is, what the standards of a good building are. The same thing goes for reconstructing arguments. 

In order to reconstruct an argument properly, we need to know what the standards are for reconstruction. We're trying to reconstruct it, so as to meet those standards. Because the goal is not to reconstruct the argument in order to make it look bad. The point is going to be to reconstruct arguments, so as to make them look good. because by making your opponents look bad or silly, that doesn't do anybody any good. If you want to learn about their perspective, and you want to learn from, their views. Then you need to reconstruct their argument, so as to make it look as good as possible. And to do that,you need to know about the standards for arguments, that is the standards that make arguments good or bad. 

So what we're going to do this week, is we're going to look first at some standards for arguments, validity and soundness in particular. And then we're going to use those standards to develop a method, called reconstruction or deep analysis. I'll explain those terms later. 

And then we're going to apply that method to a few concrete examples. In order to be able to take a passage, and take those premises and conclusions and fill them out and get a full fledged argument. That, if we've done it properly, will be as good as it can be and that we can learn from. That's the goal. Now, because an argument consists of premises and a conclusion. And the premises are supposed to be related in the right way to the conclusion, there can be two main ways for an argument to go wrong. Two main vices of argument you might say. 

The first is there might be something wrong with the premises. In particular, they might be false, or at least one of them might be false. 

Second, there might be something bad about the relation between the premises and the conclusion. The premises might fail to give a good reason for the conclusion. Now, each of these problems is something that we need to avoid. And when we do avoid them, we get the corresponding virtues, namely, validity and soundness. And those are the two notions that we want to discuss in this lecture, and the next. Let's begin with the relation between the premises and the conclusion. 

What kind of relation between the premises and the conclusion is good for an argument or makes an argument good? Well, that depends. Some arguments are deductive, and others are not. So let's focus for a moment on deductive arguments. In Deductive Arguments, the conclusion is suppose to follow from the premises. What does that mean? I mean, what does it mean for a conclusion to follow from the premises? That's a really hard notion to pin down. So what logicians usually do and what we're going to do, is focus instead on the notion of validity. And the idea is that a deductive argument is trying to structure itself, so that it's valid. And we'll explain what validity is. But for now, I want to emphasize that we're only talking about deductive arguments. There's going to be another class of arguments called inductive arguments that we'll get to later in this course. Where, they don't even pretend to be valid. They don't even pretend that the conclusion follows from the the premises. 

But just for simplicity, let's focus on deductive arguments now. And the idea is that the deductive argument, should be structured in such a way that it's valid. 

Then the next question is, what's validity? Let's start with a simple example. Suppose that you know Mary, but you don't know her children. 

However, you do know that she has one child who is pregnant, and you also know that only daughters can become pregnant. So, you have all that you need to know in order to draw further conclusion. Mainly, Mary has at least one daughter. 

So here's the argument. Mary has a child who is pregnant, only daughters can become pregnant, therefore, Mary has at least one daughter. Now, if you think about it, there's just no way, no possibility that both of those premises are true and the conclusion's false. That is the feature that we're going to call Validity. More generally, we can define validity in an argument. so that an argument is valid, if and only if it's not possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. 

That is, it's not possible for there to be a situation where both of those hold. That is, a situation where the premises are true and the conclusion is also false. Now that, might strike you as a pretty simple notion. But actually that little word possible is the problem. How do you tell what's possible or what's not possible? Well, there's not mechanical solution to that, and we'll struggle with that a little bit throughout this course. But for now, since we're right at the start, let's think of it this way. 

Is there any way for you to tell a coherent story, where the premises are true, and the conclusion's false. Can you describe a situation with that combination of truth values? That is, the premises being true, and the conclusion falls in the same situation. If you can tell a coherent story with that combination, then it's possible and the argument's not valid. But if there's no way to tell a coherent story. Where the premises are true and the conclusion's false, then the argument's valid. 

Now let's try that test on our example. 

Mary has a child who is pregnant, only daughters can be pregnant, therefore, Mary has a daughter. So, is there any way to tell a coherent story where the two premises are true. That is, where Marry has a child who is pregnant, and only daughters can be pregnant. But the conclusions false, Marry does not have a daughter. Well just try, suppose Marry has only one child and it is a son. 

There the conclusion is false, good. What about that? But then, is that son pregnant? Well, if the son is not pregnant then the first premise is false. Mary doesn't have a child who is pregnant. But if the son is pregnant somehow, don't ask me how, but if the son is pregnant, then the second premise is not true. It can't be true that only daughters can be pregnant because this child is a son. 

Okay, what if Mary has two children? Try that. Try to tell the story that way. Mary has a daughter and a son. Now, she's got a child who is pregnant, the daughter. And only daughters can be pregnant, but she has a son. Wait a minute, she's got a son and a daughter. So now the conclusion's true. Because she does have a daughter even though she also has a son. Well, oh wait, how about this one? What if Mary has a child who is biologically female, but sees himself as a male. And so she sees that child as a male, but that child is pregnant, because after all, they're biologically female. 

Now, are the premises true and the conclusion false? Does that story make sense? Wait a minute. Either, her child is a daughter or her child is a son. 

Now, if it's a daughter and it's pregnant, no problem,the conclusion's true. 

If it's a son, because that child sees himself as a male, then you've got a choice. 

Well, what about the first premise? The first premise is going to be true, she does have a child who is pregnant. But what about the second premise, only daughters can be pregnant. Wait a minute, if that really is a son, if we're going to call that a son, then, it's no longer true that only daughters can be pregnant. 

So, now the second premise is false. So, try it again. Try it with, you know, sex changes and try it with hermaphrodites, tell the story any way you want about Mary's children. And there's no way that both premises come out true when the conclusion's false. That shows that the argument is valid. It might be just that we can't imagine the coherent story which makes it invalid. But the fact that we've tried hard and looked at all the possibilities we can think of. At least gives us a good reason to think, that this argument is valid. Now, some people like to think of it in the reverse direction. 

They say, let's imagine that the conclusion's false, and then, if it has to be the case that at least one of the premises is false, the argument's valid. Then you could define validity as, it's necessarily the case that if the conclusion is false, one of the premises is false. Or, in every possible situation, if the conclusion's false, one of the premises is false. We can apply this new account of validity to the same old example. It's got to be the case. That if Mary didn't have a daughter, then she doesn't have a child who was pregnant or else, there are at least some children who are pregnant who are not daughters. So in other words, this case you're reasoning back from the falsehood of the conclusion to at least one of the premises has to be false. Where as in the earlier definition, you were saying it's not possible in the situations where the premises are true for the conclusion to be false. You can look at it either way, either direction. Just pick the one that works for you and go with that definition. Because in the end, the two definitions are equivalent. It's just a matter of what's going to help you understand which arguments are valid and which ones are not. 

In addition to understanding what validity is, it's also very important to understand what validity is not. A lot of people get confused by the notion of validity in this context, because they're thinking that, to call an argument valid, must be to call it good, right? You call a driver's license valid. When its good in the eyes of the law, but that's not what we're talking about here. The notion of validity is getting used by logitions here as a technical notion. And its very, very, very important to remember, that to call an argument valid is not to call it good. 

For some arguments like deductive arguments, being valid might be necessary for them to be good, but it's not enough. And we'll see a lot of examples of that later on. The second point about what validity is not, is that validity does not depend on whether the premises and the conclusion are actually true or false. Instead, it depends on what's possible. Whether there's a certain combination, true premises and a false conclusion, that's even possible. 

So, whether the premise is actually true in the actual world is not what's at issue. And we can see this by seeing that some arguments with false premises can still be valid. And some arguments with true conclusions can be invalid. So let's look at some examples of that. 

Indeed, there are four possibilities, because remember, the conclusion could be true or false, and premises, could be all true or at least one false. So, we've got four possibilities, and all of those are possible, except for one. The one combination that's not possible for valid arguments is True Premises and a False Conclusion. But if you've got True Premises and a True Conclusion, it might be valid, it might not. If you've got false premises in a true conclusion, it might be valid it might not. If you've got false premises, and a false conclusion, it might be valid it might not. 

So, let's look at some examples of each of those possibilities in order to better understand the relation between premises and conclusion, that exists when the argument is valid. It's hard to give examples with true premises and false conclusion, or any of these other combinations. When the truth is controversial. So we're going to have a really simple example, and we're going to start just by stipulating what the facts are. We're going to assume that all Ford cars have four tires, but some Ford cars do not have four doors. We're also going to assume that Henry's car is a Ford that has four doors. And Jane's car is a Chrysler, it has only two doors, not four doors. And we're just going to take those facts for granted and assume that that's the situation we're talking about. And then, we can give examples of all the combinations that we discussed before. 

Let's begin with true premises and a true conclusion. Here's an example, all Ford cars have four ties. Henry's car is a Ford. 

So Henry's car had, has four tires. Are the premises true? Well yeah, our assumptions tell us that all Ford cars have four tires. And then Henry's car is a Ford. What about the conclusion, is that true? Sure. That's another one of our assumptions. Henry's car has four tires. 

But, the fact that the premises are true and conclusion's also true, doesn't yet tell us it's valid. Because, to be valid, it has to be impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. There has to be no coherent story where the premises are true and the conclusions false. So what about this case? Is it valid? Well, is it possible? Is there any way to tell a coherent story where, all Ford cars have four tires? Henry's car is a Ford, but Henry's car does not have four tires just try. One way to tell not going to able to do it, is to reason backwards. Assume that the conclusion falls, that Henry's car does not have four tires, may be it got six tires. Well, then, how could both premises be true? If Henry's car is still a Ford and it has six tires, then the first premise is not true. Because the first premise says that all Ford cars have four tires, and Henry's car would then under that assumption be a Ford car without four tires, but with six tires instead. So the first premise would be false. 

Well, another possibility is that Henry's car has six tires and it's not a Ford. And then you can have the first premise true, all Ford's have four tires. But you couldn't have the second premise true, namely that Henry's car is a Ford. So there's no way when the conclusion is false, for both premises to be true and that shows you that the argument is valid. Nonetheless, there are other examples where the premises are true and the conclusion's true, but the argument is not valid. Instead it's invalid. Here's an example of that combination. All Ford cars have four tires. Henry's car has four tires. Therefore Henry's car is a Ford. Now in this new argument, are all the premises true? Yes, the first premises says, all Ford cars have four tires. And that's true by our assumption, the second premise says Henry's car has four tires. And that's also true by our assumptions. And is the conclusion true? Yes, our assumptions also tell us that Henry's car is a Ford. But, is it possible, is there any way to tell a coherent story where, those premises are true and the conclusion is false. Yes, absolutely. All that has to happen is Jane and Henry switch cars. Then, the first premises can be true, because all Ford cars have four tires, and the second premise is going to be true. Because Henry's car has four tires, of course now it's a Chrysler, because he got it from Jane. 

But the conclusion can be false Henry's car is not a Ford, because Ford and Chrysler are different companies. So if he switches cars with Jane and he has a Chrysler, then he doesn't have a Ford. He's car is not a Ford, okay? So now you've got a situation, where the premises are true, and the conclusion false. It's not an actual situation, but it's a possible situation. You can tell a coherent story, where the premises are true, and the conclusion's false. And that tells you that the argument is invalid. Next, let's consider an example with false premises and a true conclusion. 

Premise one, all Fords have four doors. Premise two, Henry's car is a Ford. 

Conclusion, Henry's car has four doors. Is the first premise true? No, it's not true that all Fords have four doors. 

Our assumptions tell us that. 

Second, is Henry's car a Ford? That's true. 

So one of the premises is false and the other one is true. That means they're not all true, and the conclusion, is that true? Yes. It is true that Henry's car has four doors. But remember, the fact that, that's actually the case doesn't tell us whether or not it's valid. So is it valid? That depends on when it's whether it's possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. 

Premises aren't actually true, but is there a possible story that you could tell that would be coherent. Where the premises are true but the conclusion, false. That's the test of validity, so lets apply it to this case. Well, just imagine that the conclusion is false. That, Henry's car does not have four doors, it's only got two doors. Then, there is really only two possibilities, Its either a Ford or it is not a Ford. If it is a Ford then the first premise is false. It is not true that all Fords have four doors. 

But if Henry's car is not a Ford, then the second premise is false, because it says that Henry's car is a Ford. So there's no coherent way in which it could possibly be true. That both of these premises are true and the conclusion's false. So this argument's valid, and notice that that shows, that an argument can be valid, even though it's got a false premise. Now, you might be thinking to yourself, this is crazy. How can an argument be valid, when one of its premises is false? I mean, an argument is not good when it's premises are false. But notice what that does. 

That confuses the notion of valid, like in a valid drivers license, where to be valid is good, with the technical notion of validity that we're using here. The technical notion of validity that we're using here, has to do with the relation between the premises and the conclusion. And in particular it has to do with possibilities. And not with the actual falsehood of the premise. So what we have to ask ourselves is, what would happen if it really were true? 

That all Fords have four doors. It's not true, in the actual world, but we're concerned with possibility. And if all Fords did have four doors, and, if Henry's car was a Ford, then it would have to have four doors. So that possibility of the premise being true, even though it's not, is what's crucial for determining validity. 
21:54
Because it's not possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. That makes it valid in our technical sense even if it's not valid in the common sense notion of validity as goodness. We're not saying the arguments are good argument, we're saying that is meets this technical definition of validity that logicians use. Now the only combination of truth values in premise and conclusion, that you cannot get with a valid argument. Is to have true premises and a false conclusion. So here's an example of that. Premise one, some Ford cars do not have four doors. Premise two, Henry's car is a Ford. Conclusion, 
22:40
Henry's car does not have four doors. 
22:43
The premises by our assumptions are both true, and the conclusions false. And it's not valid, because it's easy to see how it might be possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. It's simple. Even if some Fords don't have four doors, Henry's car is one of the Fords that does have four doors. And then, both the premises can be true, and the conclusions false. 
23:08
So that's how you can get an invalid argument with true premises and a false conclusion. But you don't even really need that. Look, every argument that has true premises and a false conclusion has to be invalid. Because if it does in fact actually have true premises and a false conclusion, then it's possible for it to have true premises and a false conclusion. So you can know right off the bat, that every argument with true premises and a false conclusion is invalid. What you can't know is for the other combinations, then you have to think through what's possible, instead of simply, what's actual. We haven't been through all of the possibilities, but we have seen that you can have invalid arguments with true premises and true conclusions. And you can have valid arguments, with false premises and true conclusions. And we've got a little table that shows us the other possibilities. Instead of going through all of those possibilities myself. I think it would be better if you did a few excercises, and that'll make sure that you understand this notion of validity, before we go on and try to show how validity is related to soundness. 

欢迎来到第三周 在第一周和第二周 我们已经学习了 许多关于如何识别和分析论证的知识 

我们能进行仔细分析 能识别前提和结论 我们可以把它们用标准的形式表示出来 那么接下来呢？ 好的 接下来的步骤是将这些部分按一定的顺序联系起来  并填补缺失的部分 我们需要学会如何重组论证 准备好了吗 重组论证有许多种方法 假设建一所房子或一幢建筑物 

为了建造一幢高质量的建筑 你要有明确目标 了解优质建筑的质量标准 重组论证也是同样的道理 

为了正确地重组一个论证 我们需要知道重组的标准 我们要尝试按照这些标准来重组它 因为我们的目标不是重组出糟糕的论证 而是重组出恰当合理的论证  因为让你的对手难堪或出丑 对任何人都没有好处 如果你希望了解他们的观点 想从他们的观点中学到东西 那么你就需要重组他们的论证 尽可能地让它看上去是合理的 为了做到这一点 你需要知道论证的标准 也就是区分论证优劣的标准 

所以这周 我们将要先看一些论证的标准 特别是有效性标准和合理性标准特别是有效性标准和合理性标准 然后我们将使用这些标准 开发出一种方法 即重建或深度分析 我将在后面解释这些术语 

然后我们将把这种方法运用到一些具体的事例中 目的是让我们能够从一段文字中 提取出前提和结论 填补其中的空白 从而得到一个完整论证 如果我们做得恰当 我们将会得到一个恰当的论证 并从中有所收获 这便是我们的目的 由于一个论证包含前提和一个结论 而且前提与结论的之间的关系应当合理 因此论证的错误主要有两种 或者说是两种主要的论证缺陷 

第一种是前提存在缺陷 特别是 前提可能是假的 或者至少其中一项前提可能是假的 

第二种 是前提和结论之间的关系是有缺陷的 前提也许不能合理地推导出结论 这些问题 每一个都是我们需要避免的 当我们规避了以上的缺陷 我们就得到了两件法宝 也就是有效性和合理性 这两个概念 是我们将要在这节课以及下节课中讨论的 让我们从前提和结论的关系开始 

前提与结论之间要有怎样的关系 才有利于论证 或者说才能使一个论证变得恰当？ 这要看情况 有一些论证是演绎性的 有一些则不是 我们先集中讨论演绎论证 在演绎论证中 结论应从前提推导得出 这是什么意思呢？ 什么叫做结论是从前提推导得出的？ 这是一个很难定义的概念 因此通常逻辑学家 还有我们接下来要做的 就是关注“有效性”的概念 意思是 演绎论证本身会构建起自己的结构 从而印证它的有效性 我们会谈到对有效性的解释 但是现在 我想强调的是 我们所讨论的演绎论证 以后还有另一种论证 归纳论证 我们将在课程后面学到 在归纳论证中 他们不需要证明有效性 甚至不需要从前提推导出结论 

但是为简单起见  我们现在只看演绎论证 演绎论证指的是 应当用使其有效的方式来构造论证 

那么下一个问题是 什么是有效性？ 让我们举一个简单的例子 假设你认识玛丽 但不认识她的孩子们 

但你知道她有一个孩子怀孕了 你也知道只有女儿才会怀孕 所以你得到了需要的所有信息 来推出进一步的结论 大体上我们可以推断出 玛丽至少有一个女儿 

这就是论证 玛丽有一个孩子怀孕了 只有女儿才会怀孕 因此玛丽至少有一个女儿 现在如果你思考一下这个例子 你会发现 不可能出现这两个前提是正确 而结论是错误的情况 这就是我们要讨论的 有效性的特征 通常我们可以这样定义论证中的有效性 当且仅当不可能出现前提正确而结论错误的情况时 这个论证就是有效的 

也就是说前提与结论不可能形成这样一种情况 即前提是真的 而结论是假的情况 你可能觉得这是一个很简单的概念 但实际上 "可能"这个小小的词却是一个问题 你如何辨别什么是可能的 或者什么是不可能的？ 事实上并不存在固定的辨别方法 本课程中我们将在这个问题上花一些精力 但目前 毕竟刚开始接触 我们就按下面的方法来考虑它 

你否能告诉我们一个合乎逻辑的例子 其中前提是真的 而结论是假的？ 你是否能描述一个这两者都是真的例子？ 也就是前提是真的 结论也是真的 如果你能举出这样组合的合乎逻辑的例子 那这就是有可能的 那么这个论证就不是有效的 但是如果不可能说出这样一个合乎逻辑的情况 其中前提是真的 而结论是假的 那么这个论证就是有效的 

现在让我们用例子验证一下 

玛丽有一个孩子怀孕了 只有女儿才能怀孕 因此 玛丽有一个女儿 那么 是否存在一个合乎逻辑的情况 两个前提都是真的 但结论是假的？ 即前提是玛丽有一个孩子怀孕了 而且只有女儿才能怀孕 但结论是 玛丽没有女儿 试想一下 如果玛丽只有一个孩子 而且是一个儿子 

那么这个结论就是假的 好的 然后呢？ 但是 是儿子怀孕吗？ 如果不是儿子怀孕 那么第一个前提就是假的 玛丽没有一个怀孕的孩子 但如果儿子怀孕了 不要问我如何怀上的 如果儿子怀孕了 那么第二个前提就不是真的 不可能只有女儿才能怀孕 因为这个孩子是儿子 

那要是玛丽有两个孩子呢？ 试着用那种方式想一下 玛丽有一个女儿和一个儿子 现在她有一个孩子怀孕了 那个女儿 只有女儿才能怀孕 但是她有一个儿子 等一下 她有一个儿子和一个女儿 这样结论就是真的 因为她的确有一个女儿 既便她还有一个儿子 等一下 如果这样呢？ 如果玛丽有一个孩子 这个孩子生理上是女性 但她把自己看成男性 因此她把这个孩子看作男孩 但是这个孩子怀孕了 因为毕竟她从生物学角度看是女性 

那现在前提是真的而结论是假的吗？ 这个故事合理吗？等一下 她的孩子要么是女儿 要么是儿子 

如果是女儿 而且怀孕了 没有问题 结论是真的 

如果是儿子 因为这个孩子把自己当成男的 那么你就得选择 

第一个前提如何？ 第一个前提是真的 她的确有一个怀孕的孩子 但是第二个前提呢？只有女儿才能怀孕 等一下 如果这个孩子确实是儿子 如果我们把他称为儿子 那么只有女儿才能怀孕就不是真的 

所以现在第二个前提就是假的 再试一下 试一下变性和雌雄同体的情况 用你的方式来讲一下玛丽孩子的故事 两个前提是真的而结论是假的情况 并不存在 那就表明这个论证是有效的 有可能是我们无法想象出一个合乎逻辑的故事来证明它是无效的 但是事实是我们已经尽了最大的努力 遍寻我们可以想到的所有可能性 至少给了我们一个很好的理由来相信 这个论证是有效的 有些人喜欢反过来考虑这个问题 

比如说 让我们想象结论是假的 如果必须至少有一个前提是假的 那么这个论证就是有效的 你就可以这样定义有效性 一个必然的情况是 如果结论是假的 其中一个前提也是假的 或者说 在所有可能的情况中 如果结论是假的 那么其中一个前提必定是假的 我们可以将这个对有效性的新定义运用到以前的例子中 必将出现以下的情况 如果玛丽没有一个女儿 那她要么没有一个怀孕的孩子 要么至少有的孩子怀孕了 但他们不是女儿 换言之 这种情况下 你是从结论的反面推导出 至少有一个前提必定是假的 在之前的定义中 我们说 不可能出现前提是真的 而结论是假的情况 你可以任取一种方法思考这个问题 选择你认为行得通的定义 并遵循它 因为说到底 这两种定义是等价的 差别只是哪一种定义能够帮助你更好地理解 .哪些论证是有效的 哪些论证不是 

除了理解什么是有效性 理解什么不是有效性也同样重要 许多人在这里搞不清楚有效性的概念 因为他们认为 一个论证是有效的 那么这个论证必须是对的 你说一个驾照是有效的 从法律角度这是对的 但这并不是我们这里所讨论的东西 有效性的概念在这里被逻辑学家用作一个专用的概念 有一点非常非常非常重要的是 要记住 说一个论证是有效的 并不是说这个论证是对的 

对于一些论证比如演绎论证而言 有效性是证明其正确性的必要条件 但这还不够 我们将在后面看到很多关于这方面的例子 关于有效性的第二点是 有效性并不取决于前提和结论实际上是真的还是假的 它反而取决于什么是有可能的 是否存在某个前提是真的而结论是假的组合 那仍然是可能的 

因此前提条件在现实世界中是否实际存在 根本不重要 我们可以看到一些情况 论证中的前提是假的 但论证仍然有效 而有些论证的结论是真实的 但论证却是无效的 让我们看一些例子 

实际上有四种情况 因为结论可能是真的或者是假的 前提可能都是真的 或者至少一个是假的 所以我们有四种情况 所有这些都是可能的 除了一种情况 前提是真的而结论是假的 是不可能存在的有效论证 但如果你的前提和结论都是真的 论证可能是有效的 也可能是无效的 如果前提是假的结论是真的 这个论证可能是有效的 也可能是无效的 如果前提是假的结论也是假的 这个论证可能是有效的 也可能是无效的 

让我们看一些这样组合的例子 以便大家更好地理解有效论证中 前提与结论之间的关系 前提与结论之间的关系 要给出真前提和假结论的例子 或者其它组合的例子 是很难的 因为真实性是存在争议的 我们举一个非常简单的例子 我们先规定一些事实 我们假定所有福特牌 (Ford) 轿车都有四个车轮 但有些福特轿车没有四个车门 我们还假定享利 (Henry) 的轿车是福特牌的 并且有四个车门 简 (Jane) 的轿车是克莱斯勒 (Chrysler) 的 它只有两个车门而不是四个车门 我们假定这些都是理所当然的事实 并假定这是我们要讨论的情景 我们就可以对之前讨论的所有组合 举出例子 

我们从真前提和真结论开始 举个例子 所有福特牌轿车都有四个车轮 享利的轿车是福特牌的 

所以享利的轿车有四个车轮 所有的前提都是真的吗？ 对的 我们的假设已经告诉我们 所有福特牌轿车都有四个车轮 享利的轿车是福特牌的 那么结论是真的吗？ 智力肯定会有影响 这是我们的假定之一 享利的轿车有四个车轮 

但是真前提和真结论 并不能告诉我们论证是有效的 因为要证明有效 必须是不存在前提为真而结论是假的可能性 也就是不存在一个前提是真的而结论是假的 合乎逻辑的情况 那这个例子呢？ 有没有可能 是否存在这样一个合乎逻辑的情况 所有福特车都有4个车轮 享利的轿车是福特牌 但享利的车并没有4个车轮？试试看 一种方法是反向推理出不可能 假定结论是假的 享利的车子没有四个车轮 可能有六个车轮 那怎么可能同时满足两个前提？ 如果享利的车是福特牌的 并且有六个车轮 那么第一个前提就不是真的 因为第一个前提指出所有福特车都有四个车轮 在那样的假设之下  享利的车就是一辆没有四个车轮的福特车 而是有六个车轮 所以第一个前提就是假的 

另一个可能性是享利的轿车有六个车轮 但它不是福特牌 这样第一个前提就是真的 即所有福特车都有四个车轮 但是第二个前提就不是真的 即享利的轿车是福特牌 因此一个有效的论证不可能出现结论是假的 而两个前提都是真的情况 但是 还有一些例子是 前提是真的 结论也是真的 但论证没有效 也就是无效的 看看这种组合的例子 所有福特轿车都有四个车轮 享利的轿车有四个车轮 因此享利的轿车是福特牌轿车 在这个新的论证中 所有的前提都是真的吗？ 是的 第一个前提说 所有福特轿车都有四个车轮 根据我们的假定 这个前提是真的 第二个前提是 享利的轿车有四个车轮 根据我们的假定 这个前提也是真的 那么结论是真的吗？ 是的 我们的假定告诉我们 享利的轿车是福特牌 但是有没有可能举出一个合理的例子 前提是真的 而结论是假的呢？ 可以 当然可以 只需要简与享利换车 那么第一个前提是真的 因为所有福特轿车都有四个车轮 第二个前提也是真的 因为享利的轿车有四个车轮 当然现在变成了克莱斯勒轿车 因为他从简那里得到它 

但是结论是假的 享利的轿车不是福特牌 因此福特和克莱斯勒是不同的公司 所以如果享利与简换车 他有了一辆克莱斯勒的车 那么他就没有一辆福特车 他的轿车不是福特牌的 对不对？ 所以现在有了这样的情况 前提是真的而结论是假的 这不是实际的情况 但它是可能的情况 你就可以举出一个合理的例子 其中前提是真的 而结论是假的 那就告诉我们 这个论证是无效的 下面让我们考虑一个例子 假前提和真结论 

前提一 所有福特轿车都有四个车门 前提二 享利的轿车是福特牌 

结论是 享利的轿车有四个车门 第一个前提是真的吗？ 不 我们的假定告诉我们 

所有福特车都有四个车门这个前提不是真的 

第二 享利的轿车是福特牌的吗？ 这个前提是真的 

所以其中一个前提是假的 另一个是真的 那意味着不是所有前提都是真的 那么结论是真的吗？ — 是的 享利的轿车有四个车门是真的 但是记住 那实际上并不能告诉我们论证是否有效 那它是有效的吗？ 那取决于 前提是真而结论是假的情况前提是真而结论是假的情况 

前提实际上不是真的 但是否存在合理的可能情况 其中前提是真的但结论是假的 这就是对于有效性的验证 让我们验证一下这个例子 想象一下结论是假的 也就是享利的轿车没有四个车门 它只有两个车门 那么 就只有两种可能性 它要么是福特车 要么不是福特车 如果它是福特车 那么第一个前提就是假的 所有福特车都有四个车门就不是真的 

但如果享利的轿车不是福特牌  那么第二个前提就是假的 因为它说享利的轿车是福特牌 所以没有办法找到一个合理的情况 使得两个前提都是真的而结论是假的 所以这个论证是有效的 要注意的是 虽然这个例子中有一个前提是假的 但论证是有效的 现在你可能觉得 这很不合理 当其中一个前提是假的时候 论证怎么可能是有效的呢？ 我的意思是 当一个前提为假 该论证就为假 但是要注意的是 

那混淆了有效性 比如说有效驾照的概念 和我们这里学术上有效性的概念 我们这里所使用的有效性的学术概念 是描述前提与结论之间关系的 而且特别是用来描述可能性的 而不是针对前提的实际对错 因此我们要问的是  如果这实际上为真 那会发生什么情况？ 

如果所有福特车都有四个车门 在现实世界中这不是真的 但我们关注的是可能性 如果所有福特车确实都有四个车门 且享利的轿车是福特牌 那么它必定有四个车门 所以 就算前提不是真的  但前提在真实情况下存在可能性 才是判断有效性的关键 

因为不可能存在前提为真结论为假的情况 所以 尽管它不是常识中所认为的 有效即正确 但是它在专用意义上是有效的 我们不说论证是正确的 我们说它是满足逻辑学家所使用的 有效性的专用概念 现在 从一个有效论证中 你唯一无法得到的 是真前提和假结论的组合 这是一个例子 前提一 有些福特车没有四个车门 前提二 享利的轿车是福特车 

结论 享利的轿车没有四个车门 

根据我们的假定 两个前提都是真的 结论是假的 显然 真前提和假结论是有可能的 这个论证是无效的 很简单很简单 既使有些福特车没有四个车门 但是享利的轿车是有四个车门的福特车 那么两个前提都是真的 结论是假的 

所以这就是你怎样根据真前提和假结论 得到无效的论证 但是你不需要那样 每一个拥有真前提和假结论的论证 都是无效的 因为如果前提为真 结论为假 那么就有可能出现真前提假结论的情况 那么你立刻就能知道 每一个有着真前提和假结论的论证都是无效的 你无法判断的是其它的组合 那么你就必须充分考虑可能的情况 而不是简单思考实际情况 我们没有讨论所有的可能性 但是我们已经看到 从真前提和真结论可以得到无效的论证 以及从假前提和真结论 可以得到有效的论证 我们这里有一张表 显示了其它的可能性 我想如果你自己来做些练习 会比我来解释所有的情况更好 那会确保 在我们继续讨论有效性和可靠性的关系之前 你能够理解有效性的概念 【果壳教育无边界字幕组】校对：aPRIltenYY 审核：Reckless-bell 

### soundness

The next question has probably been bothering you ever since very early on in the previous lecture. 

Namely, if valid arguments can have false premises, then what good are they? Sure, there's this technical logician's notion of valid argument, but why should we care whether arguments are valid if valid arguments can be really bad? 

Validity might be necessary for an argument to be good or at least for deductive argument to be good. Because remember, there are also inductive arguments, but even though it's necessary, it's not enough. You can have a horrible argument that's still valid. The great thing about validity is that when a valid argument has true premises, then you get something that really is reliable, namely, soundness. 

Because if you know that the premises are true and you also know that it's not possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false, then you know the conclusion must be true. 

So in a sound argument the conclusion has to be true. And that is what makes it valuable, because if we can get a deductive argument to be sound, then you really got something. What you've got, is a true conclusion. Officially then, a sound argument is one where the premises are true, and the argument is valid. 

And we've got the same combinations of truth and falsity as possibilities that we had in valid arguments. You can have both premises and conclusion are true and then if it's valid, the argument's sound. And if it's not valid, it's not. 

Or you can have, the premises are true and the conclusion's false. And then it can't be valid. But if it's invalid, it's not sound. 

Or you can have, the premises are false and the conclusion's true. And then if it's valid, it's not sound. And if it's invalid it's not sound. We can have both the premises and the conclusion are false. And then it's not going to be sound whether it's valid or not. So the only combination where it's sound is when the premises are true and the argument is valid and in that case you know that the conclusion is true. What about lack of soundness? Well, there are two ways for an argument to fail to be sound, mainly either the argument can be invalid or whether its premises can be false. So it's a lot easier for an argument to be unsound. 

And we know that a deductive argument tries to be valid and of course it wants its premises to be true. So a deductive argument is trying to be sound. When it fails to be sound, it's not going to be any good. 

Now the next question is, how can you know? 

If you don't know whether the premises are true, you're not going to know whether the argument is sound. Well, not quite. Because if you, if the argument's valid and you know it's valid, then you don't know whether it's sounds unless you know the premises are true. But if you know the argument's invalid, you already know it's unsound. Even if you don't know whether the premises are true. So if you think about it that shows why you want to be able to test for validity, because if you can show the arguments is invalid, then you're going to be able to say, well I know it's unsound regardless of what you think about whether the premises are true or not. 

So there's going to be some value to validity. Namely, if you can show it's invalid, you're going to show it's unsound, and that means that the deductive argument didn't get what it wanted. 

So validity is going to be necessary for soundness, and soundness is going to be important because it guarantees the truth of the conclusion. And then validity derives it's value from the fact that if it's not valid it's not sound. Okay, now there's a lot more to say about validitiy and we'll say a lot more about validity when we get to formal logic in the second part of this course, but for now we're just going to stick with this pretty intuitive notion of validity and see how we can use this notion of validity to reconstruct arguments. 

我们接下来会讨论的问题 可能早在之前的课上就难住了你 

即 如果有效论证的前提可以为假 这样的论证又有什么用？ 当然 逻辑学家给出了有效论证的专业定义  但问题是 如果有效论证有缺陷 我们为何还要关注论证的有效性呢？ 

有效性是使论证或演绎论证 变得恰当合理的必要标准 别忘了 我们还有归纳式论证 尽管有效性是必要标准 但对论证来说还不够 你的有效论证大可以很糟糕 有效性的优点在于当一个有效论证的前提为真时 你将得到真实可靠的结果 即 可靠性 

因为如果已知前提为真 并且不可能存在 前提为真结论为假的情况 那么结论就一定是真的 

因此 在一个可靠论证过程中 结论一定为真 这就是可靠性的意义 因为 如果我们能获得一个可靠的演绎论证 那你会得到真实有效的结论 正式地说 可靠论证就是 前提为真且论证有效 

在有效论证里 我们会遇到有真也有假的情况  当你的前提和结论为真 且论证有效 那么论证即可靠 如果论证无效 则不可靠 

或者 如果前提为真 结论为假 那么论证一定无效 论证无效 就不具有可靠性 

另一种情形是 前提为假 结论为真 即使论证有效 它也是不可靠的 若是论证无效 它还是不可靠的 最后的情况是前提和结论都是假的 那么无论是否有效 论证都是不可靠的 所以可靠性的唯一可能组合就是前提为真并且论证有效  这种情况下你知道结论一定为真 缺乏可靠性又是什么情况呢？ 有两种情况 使得论证不可靠 一种是论证本身无效 另一种是前提为假 所以论证本身非常容易变得不可靠 

我们知道 演绎论证总是试图维持有效性 而且希望前提是真实的 所以一个演绎论证总是试图维持可靠性 当失去可靠性时 论证就变得很糟糕 

接下来的问题是 如何获知可靠性 

如果你不知道前提是否为真 你就没办法知道论证是否可靠 不过，也不一定 如果你已知论证有效 除非你已知前提为真 否则你无法知道它是否可靠  但是如果已知论证无效 便可以得出不可靠的结论 即使你不知道前提是否为真 所以稍加思考就可以知道为何你会想要测试有效性  因为如果你可以证明论证是无效的  那么 你就可以说 这个论证无论前提如何 都是不可靠的 

这就是有效性的意义 也就是说 如果你可以证明无效性  便可以证明不可靠 进而意味着演绎论证 无法得到它想要的结果 

因此 有效性是可靠性的必要条件 而可靠性的重要性在于它保证结论的真实性 因此有效性的价值在于 如果论证无效则一定不可靠 好了 现在关于可靠性有更多可以展开的话题 我们会在这门课的第二部分学习 形式逻辑的时候进一步讨论 我们目前暂且凭借 我们对有效性概念的直观感受 来看如何用有效性来重建论证 【教育无边界字幕组】校对：橡胶万岁 审核：Reckless-bell 


## Revealing the Basic Structure

### get down to basic

Now that we understand validity, we can use the notion of validity in reconstructing arguments. Now the point of reconstructing an argument, is to put it in a shape that makes it easier for us to assess the argument more accurately and fearly for whether it's a good argument or a bad argument. 

And when you do the reconstruction remember you want to make it as good an argument as possible, because you don't learn anything by putting down your enemies by making them look silly. Right? If you want to learn from somebody else's argument, you need to put it in the best shape you can to make it look as good as possible. 

So, that's going to be the goal of reconstruction and we're going to accomplish that goal in a series of stages. The first stage is simply to do a close analysis and we talked about that last week. The second stage is to get down to basics and is to remove all the excess words and focus on the premises and conclusion that really make up the argument and then put those into standard form. 

The third stage is to clarify those premises. They're not always going to be as clear as you like, and that's going to take some work, and it's going to include breaking them into parts. And then the next stage is to take those parts and organize them, to put them in order, so you can see how the argument flows from one part to another. But not all arguments are complete. So the next stage, we have to fill in the gaps. That is, supply suppressed premises. 

And once we've done that, then the final stage is going to be to assess the argument. If we are able to come up with a sound reconstruction, we know that the conclusion has to be true. Because. As we learned in the previous lecture, the conclusion of sound arguments is always true. But if we don't come up with a sound reconstruction, then we've got to decide is it the fault of the argument or is it our own fault because we didn't come up with a sound reconstruction when there really is one that we didn't find. So that's going to be something we have to discuss. We're going to discuss all of these stages over the next few lectures. Now, the first stage of reconstruction is to do a close analysis, but we already learned how to do that. That was easy. Boy, hope the rest of them are that easy. This lecture is mainly going to be about the second stage namely getting down to basics. And what we want to do is to pull out the explicit premise and conclusion from all the other words around it. And the first step is to remove all the access verbiage. You know, it might seem really surprising, but people often repeat themselves. I'm sure you've all run in to it. I mean, listen to somebody give a talk, and it takes them 50 minutes to say what they could've said easily in five minutes. And one of the reasons is that they say everything 10 times. You know, for instance, people often say the same thing twice. They repeat themselves. They say the same thing over again. And they restate the same thing in different words. They utter sentences that mean the same thing and they say something and you know, then they say it again, and they make a claim twice or more. They assert exactly what they just said, and they reformulate their claim in different words that are equivalent. They say it once, and then they say it again. You get the idea. 

Now here's a real example from a U.S, politician during a debate. I want to be honest with people. We can't eliminate this deficit. People have heard that over and over again in four years. We cannot do it. We're in too deep a hole. Now, if you think about it. It's going to be obvious that we cannot do it. Repeat, we can't eliminate this deficit. because that's what doing it is, eliminating the deficit. But also, we're into deep a hole. Well that's just a metaphorical way of saying the same thing. Why is the hole too deep? because we can't get out of it. What hole is it? It's the deficit hole, so to say we can't get out of this hole, we're in too deep a hole is just another way of saying we can't eliminate the deficit, so in these three lines he's already repeated himself three times. Now why does this politician repeat himself? It might be that he thinks people will remember it better or that one version will make more sense than another. But he might have a special reason because this was a live debate and he had to give a 90 second answer. So he had to fill up the time. Sometimes people repeat themselves just to fill up the time or maybe to give himself time to think because he didn't have a real answer ready yet. And repeating himself is easy while he thinks about what he's really going to say in the next few sentences. 

Fine, but repeating it still doesn't make the argument any better. And, we want to get down to the basics of the argument. That is, the parts of the argument that really effect how good it is. So we can cross out those repetitions that don't make the argument any better. So first, we can cross out we cannot do it. Then we can cross out we're into deep a hole. We already saw that those are just repeating the claim that we can't eliminate the deficit. In addition, we can cross out I want to be honest with people because that's not a reason to believe that we're in too deep a deficit. And, next, we can cross out, that people have heard that over and over again in four years. Well, that might be seen as a reason to believe that we're in a deficit, because everybody seems to say it, but, let's assume that's not part of his argument here and we'll cross it out. Now, let's move on. A second form of excess verbiage. That is, words that don't contribute to the force of the argument, is what I like to call road markers. A lot of times, people, you know, good speakers. They tell you what topic they're talking about, and why they're talking about it. Why it's important, and worth talking about. But to say why it's an important issue. And to say what issue it is. Doesn't provide any reason to believe that what they say about the issue is true or false. So it doesn't contribute to the argument. Here's an example from the same politician in the same debate as we just saw. 

This politician said. Now I want to go back to the whole issue of health care because we touched it and I think the American people deserve to know what we would do different. Now notice, he says he's going to talk about healthcare but, he doesn't say anything about healthcare he doesn't tell you what he's going to say about healthcare. All he says he wants to go back to that issue and he tells you why he wants to go back to that issue. But he doesn't add any reason to believe that what he's about to say about the issue is true. Now this can of course still be useful because. You might get confused about what the issue is. And he might be changing the topic and he wants to signal that he is changing the topic. And that'll help his listeners. But it still doesn't add to the argument. It doesn't give you any reason for the conclusion that he is going to want to draw. We can cross out these excess words. We can cross out, now I want to go back to the whole issue of healthcare. Because that doesn't show that his views on healthcare are correct. And we can cross out, because we touched it. That's a reason why we're going to that issue. But again, that doesn't give any reason why his views are correct. And we can even cross out that I think the American people deserve to know. But we would do different. Because the fact that they deserve to know what you're going to do doesn't show that what you're going to do is the right thing to do. So none of these claims are really reasons. They're going to be reasons for the main part of his argument. Which is to support the particular views on healthcare that he's going to tell you about, a few seconds after this. 

The next type of access verbiage is tangents. People go off on tangents all the time. Here is an example. 

You know, you really ought to think about taking a history course. I, I still remember my history courses in college. [UNKNOWN] There's this one time when. There's a dog that one of the students brought to class and, and the dog like barked and then he ran up on stage and he, he cut under the professor and knocked the professor on his rear end, it was really funny. So you know I think that history is a good thing to study. Now notice that all this stuff about the dog has nothing to do with history. It's no reason to take a history course instead of a philosophy course, or a classics course, or a science course. The same thing could happen in those courses just as well. So, the tangent plays a certain role. It makes it interesting, it keeps your attention, maybe it makes it memorable for you, what he said, but it doesn't actually provide a reason why, you ought to take a history course. So, since those parts of the words were just a tangent, that don't provide any reason we can cross them out too because they are excess verbiage. But sometimes people go off on irrelevant not just by accident because they lose their train of thought, but because their trying to fool you. They're trying to produce what's called a red herring, the, the name red herring supposedly comes from somebody who crossed the red herring over the trail and then the hounds couldn't track his scent any more. And that's basically what's going on here. Sometimes people produce tangents that distract you from the main line of argument, because they know that their weakness in that line of argument and they don't want you to notice them. That's what a red herring is and its a type of tangent that you have to learn to watch out for. Because if you want to see the problems in your opponent's arguments or even in your friend's arguments, then you need to not get distracted by tangents that are in a fact, red herring. 

Yet another example of excess verbiage is well, examples. Here's an example. Of that. 

A different politician, in the same debate said this, here's what's happened; in the time that they have been in office, in the last four years, 1.6 million private sector jobs have been lost, 2.7 million manufacturing jobs have been lost. And it's had real consequences in places like Cleveland. Cleveland is a wonderful, distinguished city that's done a lot of great things, but it has the highest poverty rate in the country. One out of almost two children in Cleveland are now living in poverty. 

Then notice that this politician is talking about the unemployment rate in the rest of the country, in the country as a whole. So why bring in Cleveland? Well, you might be saying that Cleveland shows that there's problems throughout the rest of the country but that can't be right because. Cleveland's just one example. And it might be an outlier that doesn't represent the general trends. So what he's really doing with this example is, he's trying to bring it down to home. And make you feel for the real effects. But he doesn't come out and say that you can generalize from Cleveland to the rest of the country. Or that everyone else is suffering in exactly the same way. He's just giving one example. And so, it doesn't really support his general claim, that the unemployment is a problem throughout the whole country. 

That means, that it's not an extra premise in the argument, and we can cross it out like other forms of excess verbiage. Now we've seen that excess verbiage can take the form of repetition. Road markers, or tangents, or examples and people use these alot. Matter of fact, I'd like to think of a general trick that people use called the trick of excess verbiage. A lot of people talk too much, and they keep saying things over and over again, go off on tangents, and give more examples than they really need, and all of that is a way of hiding the problem with their position. It's a trick to use too many words, because, the real point gets lost in the middle of those words, 

so you can fool people by throwing in those extra words. That's the trick of excess verbiage. 

But, be careful. What seems like excess verbiage that's just there to trick you might really be an essential part of the argument. So what you need to do when you have a passage and you're trying to get the argument out of it is to cross out all of the excess words, but also look at what's left over. If what's left over is enough premises and conclusion to make a good argument then this stuff that you crossed out probably really is excess. But if it turns out that what's left over is not a very good arguments, you ought to check all those words you crossed out and make sure they really weren't necessary, because you're not being fair, to the person that you're interpreting, if you crossed out something that was an essential part of the argument. 

And some cases, are going to be tricky. It's not going to be clear whether or not to cross them out. 

Some small words that are tricky are guarding terms. Here's an example. I think Miranda is at home, so we can meet her there. What's the guarding word? You already found that out when you did the close analysis. Right? I think. 

Now one way to read this argument is, that the premise is I think Miranda is a home, and the conclusion is we can meet her there. 

But that's kind of weird, because the fact that you think she's at home is not what makes it true that you can meet her there. It's the fact that she is at home that it can make it the case that you can meet her there. So if the premise is about what you think and the conclusion is about where she is, and where you can meet her. And the argument doesn't make any sense. So, in this case, what we want to do is to cross out the words I think because that's going to make the argument look silly. And the argument really amounts to Miranda is at home, so we can meet her there, and the I think covers that whole thing. It's saying, I think she's at home, so I think we can meet her there. But the argument doesn't involve some premise about what your thoughts are. And contrast this with a different argument. Miranda's at home, so we can probably meet her there. 

Now, there's another guarding term. Right? Probably. 

Can you get rid of that? Well then, the argument becomes. Miranda is at home, so we can meet her there. But that's clearly not the speaker was trying to say. If they included the word probably, they'll realize that the fact that she's at home right now doesn't mean that we can meet her there because it might take us a while to get there. And she might leave while we're on the way. 

So its not fair to the person giving the argument and it makes the argument look worse, to cross out the word probably. So in that case you want to keep the guarding term, in order to properly represent the force of the argument. So it looks like sometimes, you need to keep the guarding terms. And sometimes, you need to cross them out. And there's not going to be any strict rule that you can follow. You have to use your sense of what's going to make the argument as good as possible. What's going to fit what the speaker was really trying to say? Another tricky case is assuring term. 

Suppose I'm writing a letter of recommendation and I say, he is clearly a great worker. I know that, so you ought to hire him. The assuring terms are clearly and I know that. 

But now the question is, is the argument really first premise, he's clearly a great worker. Second premise, I know that. Conclusion, you ought to hire them. It's kind of weird again if you think about it, because you're not hiring him because its clear. If he's a great worker but it's not clear that he's a great worker, then you still ought to hire him because he's still a great worker. Or if he's a great worker and I don't know he's a great worker, you still ought to hire him because he's still a great worker. The fact that I know it is irrelevant to whether you ought to hire him because that's about my mental states not his abilities. 

So that representation of the argument doesn't really capture the force of somebody who writes this letter of recomendation. 

So we can cross out the words I know that and we can cross out clearly and then the argument is, he's a great worker so you ought to hire him. But contrast this example, I am certain that Jacob is cheating on his wife, 

so I ought to tell her. Now you might think I am certain that is just another assuring term, so we can cross it out. And then the real argument is Jacob is cheating on his wife, so I ought to tell her. But now think about that argument. The mere fact that he's cheating on his wife doesn't mean I ought to tell her if I'm not certain. because if I have some suspicions or I'm just guessing but I really don't know then I probably ought not to tell Jacob's wife that, you know Jacob is cheating on her. So here the force of the argument does seem to depend on my certainty. If I'm not certain I shouldn't tell her. If I am certain maybe I should. So we can't cross out the assuring term in this case, because that would distort the argument. Now, of course, some people might disagree with that. They might say, well look, if you have some reason but you're not certain you ought to tell her. And that can be controversial. But we're talking here not about what those people think, but what, the speaker thinks, the person giving this argument, when this person said, I'm certain that Jacob is cheating on his wife, they seem to indicate that to them, the fact they're certain provides an even better reason, why he should tell Jacob's wife. So, if we want to capture what the person giving the argument intended. In this case, we have to leave in the assuring term. So we've seen one example where you ought to get rid of the assuring terms. And another example where you ought to keep the assuring terms. And just like with guarding terms, the same point applies, there's no mechanical rule that'll apply to every case. You have to think through the argument and decide whether crossing out those words and removing them distorts the argument or instead crossing them out makes the argument look even better. Because the point of removing excess verbiage is to get rid of the things that aren't necessary, but keep everything that is necessary to make the argument look as good as it possibly can look. Finally, once we've removed all the excess verbiage, what's left over? The answer is, the explicit premises and conclusion in the argument. The point of removing the excess verbiage was to separate those essential parts of the argument, those basics of the argument from, all the stuff that's unnecessary. Of course, we still have to decide which ones are premises and which one is the conclusion. Right? And that's why the close analysis helps because we indicated which ones were reason markers and which ones were conclusion markers, and that lets you identify that these are the premises and that's the conclusion, and so now, we can do step three, we can put the argument in standard form. We put the premises above the line. And we put dot pyramid and then the conclusion below the line. And we've got the argument in standard form. Which completes stage two of the reconstruction project. At this point, it's useful to look back at the passage, and see whether you've gotten rid of all the excess included, all of the basics of the argument. So you can look at the passage and say is everything that's not crossed out in a premise or a conclusion of the standard form. And if there's something that's still there in the passage that isn't used you got to decide at that point, is it really excess or not. 

And of course If the argument looks really bad you've gotta look back and see whether it's missing something that you had crossed out as being excess verbiage when it really was an essential part of the argument. So we can use this process of putting it into standard form as a test of whether we've performed properly the other step of getting rid of excess verbiage. So steps, two and three really work together in this stage two of getting down to basics. That's what helps us to use the different parts to see whether we've done each of them properly. 

我们已经了解了有效性之后  就能在重构论证中使用这个概念 重构一个论证的重点就在于 使它成为另一种形式 方便我们评估得更准确工整 无论这个论证是好的还是坏的 

当你重构论证时 要尽可能把它做好 因为贬低你的对手 使他们出丑 不能教会你任何东西 对吧? 如果你想学习别人的论证  你必须把它以最佳形式呈现 尽你所能使它变好 

所以 那就是重构的目的所在 而我们将会 用一系列的步骤来达成这个目标 第一步很简单 就是做一个周密分析  我们上个礼拜谈到过 第二步是处理基本条件 除去所有的多余词汇 只关注真正构成论证的前提和结论 再将其变为标准形式 

第三步是阐明前提 它们不总是如你所愿般清晰 这会比较费力 包括把它们分成不同的部分 下一阶段就是把这些部分组织起来 规整语句 所以你能看到 论证是如何从一个部分转接到另一个部分的 但是不是所有的论证都是完整的 所以下一个阶段 我们需要补全这些所缺失的信息 也就是 提供隐含的前提 

一旦我们完成了这一步 那么最后 的阶段就是评估这个论证了 如果我们能想出一个合理的 重构 我们就知道这个结论一定是对的 因为 就像我们在上一课里了解到的那样 合理的论证的结论一定为真 但是如果我们没有想出一个合理的重构 那么 我们就必须确定这是论证本身的谬误呢还是 有一个合理的论证只是因为我们的错误而没有 能够将它重构出来 因此 这就是我们要讨论的东西了 我们要在接下来的几节课中讨论这些阶段 现在 重构的第一个步骤是做一个周密 分析 但我们已经学习了如何去做 这很简单 同学们 希望剩下的也一样简单 这堂课主要就是围绕 第二阶段的 也就是着手处理基础部分 我们想做的是从多余的词语中抽离出 明确的前提和结论 第一个步骤是删除所有的废话 你知道 这听起来 可能令人吃惊 但是人们确实经常重复他们说的话 我确信你已经很熟悉这个过程了 我的意思是 听一个人花50分钟来讲他 实际上只要花5分钟就能讲完的东西 而且其中一个原因是他们无论说什么都会重复10次 你知道 比如 人们经常重复说同一件事两次 他们重复他们自己的话 他们不断地说同一件事情 而且他们反复重申 同一件事 用不同的词语 他们发表意思相同的句子而且他们说一件事 你 知道 他们又说了一遍 他们发表了一个声明两次或更多 他们正是复述他们刚刚说的 他们 用不同的词再形式化了他们的声明 但实质是一样的 他们说过一次然后他们又说了一次 你懂得 

现在这是一场美国政治辩论的真实案例 "我希望和人们以诚相待 我们无法消除赤字 四年来 人民不断听到这些 我们做不到 我们深陷泥潭 如果你思考过这个问题  很明显我们做不到 是重复 “我们无法消除 赤字” 因为这就是那个做不到的事 消除赤字 但是 “我们深陷泥潭”也是 这只不过是同样一件事情的隐喻说法罢了 为什么这个泥潭太深？因为我们出不来 是什么样的泥潭呢？ 是赤字的泥潭 所以我们爬出不来 我们 陷得太深只是“我们无法消除赤字”的另一种说法 所以在这三行里他重复了自己三次 那么为什么这位政治家会重复他自己呢？ 有可能他认为人们会记得更深 或者一个版本比另一个版本更有意义 但是他可能有一个特殊的理由因为这是一个 现场辩论而且他必须给出一个90秒钟的答复 所以他必须填满这些时间 有时候人们重复他们自己只是为了填满时间或者 可能是为了给他们自己思考的时间 因为 他还没有准备好一个真正的答案 而重复他自己是一个简单的方式来让他思考 他接下来真正想说的几句话 

翻译: WindyZhang | 审核: Genie05 sjzcmm Coursera Global Translator Community它会自动平衡股票和债券  好吧 但是重复仍然不能强化你的论证 而我们希望着手处理论证的基础部分 也就是 那些真正影响到论证好坏的部分 所以我们就能删掉那些并不能使论证更好的 重复的内容 因此第一步 我们可以删掉“我们做不到” 然后我们可以删掉“我们深陷泥潭” 我们已经看出那些只是在重复 "我们无法消除赤字“的声明 另外 我们可以删掉”我希望和人民以诚相待“ 那不是一个相信我们深陷债务泥潭的好理由 然后 接下来 我们可以删掉”四年来 人们已经 不断听到这些” 嗯，也许这看起来是一个相信我们深陷赤字 的理由 因为大家似乎 都在谈论它 但是 让我们假设这并不是他 的论证的一部分 我们此处将删除这部分 现在 我们继续 第二种形式的多余废话 就是 词语并不有力地支持 论证 我称它为“路标” 很多时候 人们 你知道 好的演讲家 他们告诉你他们讨论的话题和他们为什么讨论它 为什么它是重要的而且值得讨论 但是说为什么一个话题重要和说一个话题是什么 并不能给他们的话题是真或者假 提供任何的值得相信的理由 所以这并不能支持论证 这是在同一个政治家的同一场辩论中的一个例子 

这位政治家说道 "我想要回到整个医疗保险的问题上来 因为我们触及到 它而且我认为美国人民应该了解到我们能做得多么不同“ 现在请注意 他说他想要讨论 医疗保险 但是 他没有提到任何有关医疗保险的事情 他 没有告诉你他想针对医疗保险说些什么 他只是说他想要回到这个话题而且 他告诉你为什么他想要回到这个话题 但是他没有给出任何理由让你相信 围绕话题所说的是真的 现在这些当然还是有用的 因为 你可能会对他要说的话题感到困惑 而他可能 在此转换话题并且他想要表明他会转换话题 而这会帮助到他的听众 但是仍然无法加强他的论证 这并不会给你任何支持他想要推出的结论 的理由 我们可以删除那些多余词语 我们可以删掉”我想要回到整个医疗保险的问题上来“ 因为那并不表示他对医疗保险的观点是对的 然后我们删除这句话 我们已经讨论过这个话题 那是为什么我们要讨论这个话题的理由 但是 再次 那并不能给出任何支持他的观点是对的的理由 而且我们甚至可以删除“而且我认为美国人民应该了解到 我们能做得多么不同“ 因为他们应该知道你会做什么的事实 并不表明你所要做的事情就是对的 所以 没有一个声明是真正的理由 应该要有理由来构成他的论证的主要部分 这些理由能够支持他对医疗保险的特定观点 是在几秒钟之后 他将要告诉你的 

下一种跳过废话的方法是相切 人们总是跑题 这是一个例子。 

你知道 你真的需要考虑去上一门历史课了 我 我仍然记得我在大学里上的历史课 这个著名的sin函数 有一次当 有个学生把一条狗带到 班上 那条狗又叫又跑 跳上讲台 咬了教授 追打教授的屁股 有趣极了 所以 你懂的 我觉得历史课真的值得一上 现在注意到所有刚刚说的其实和历史课一点关系都没有 根本没有理由去上一个历史课而 不去上哲学课 或者古典文学课 科学课程 其他这些课上也一样能发生这种事 因此 跑题在这里扮演了某种角色 它使得论证更有趣 更吸引你 可能这会是你对他所说的事情更难忘 但是这并不能提供一个 你要去上历史课的准确的理由 因此 由于这些部分 的描述只是一个跑题的描述 它并不提供任何理由 我们可以删掉它 因为它是冗余废话 但是有时候人们跑题 并不只是思绪短路这样的偶然因素 的偶然因素 而是因为他们想要耍你 他们想要产生一种称之为 “熏鲱鱼”的东西 “熏鲱鱼”的说法来自于 有的人用熏鲱鱼拖过小道使得 猎狗无法通过气味追踪他的典故 而这就是刚刚发生的事 有的人会产生一些不切题的内容来转移你对 主要论点的注意力 因为他们知道 他们在这个论证中的弱点 并且他们不希望你注意到这些弱点 这就是“熏鲱鱼” 这是一种跑题的技巧 你必须警惕 因为如果你想要在你的对手或者朋友的论证里 找到问题所在 那你就必须不能被不切题的东西所误导 也就是我们说的“熏鲱鱼” 

然后另外一个冗余废话的例子就是 举例 这里就有这样一个例子 

另一个政治家 在同一场辩论中说道  "在他们还在办公室的那段时间里 在过去的四年中 160万私营部门岗位被 取消了 270万制造业岗位被取消 而这在克利夫兰造成了真实的影响 克利夫兰是一个美好的 出众的做出了许多伟大事业的城市 但是现在该市的贫困率高居全国之首 克利夫兰大概二分之一的儿童生活在贫困中“ 

注意到这位政治家谈论的是失业率 在国家的其他地方 或者是全国整体的失业率 那么为什么要提到克利夫兰？ 嗯 你可能会说克利夫兰表面了这个问题 在国家的其他地方也一样 但是这并不对 因为 克利夫兰只是一个例子 而且它可能是个例外并不代表整体趋势 所以他举这个例子的真实目的是 他想把问题带到现场 这样能够使你感觉到压力 但是他没有提出说你 可以从克利夫兰的情况概括整个国家 或者说全国的其他人也像克利夫兰一样遭受同样的情况 他只是举了一个例子而已 所以 这并不能支持他的概括性的陈述 也就是失业在全国范围内都是一个大问题 

这意味着 在论证中并没有增加一个前提 我们可以像删掉其他废话一样删掉它 现在我们已经看到了废话可以从重复 路标 不切题 或者举例不当中来而且人们经常用 事实上 我想可以称人们用的通常手段 为”废话技巧“ 很多人一直在说话 而且他们不停地 重复一件事 跑题  给出多余的例子 而且所有的 手段只是为了掩盖他们所处地位的问题 这是一种堆砌辞藻的技巧 因为 真正的论点会迷失在这些辞藻里 

因此你可以用多余的词语戏耍他人 这就是”废话技巧“ 

但是 请小心 那些看起来像是想要戏弄你的废话 有可能还真是论证中的关键部分 所以 当你拿到一段话并且想要从 一段废话中提炼论证的时候 注意看那些 删掉后剩下的话 如果剩下的足够构成前提而且能使论证 有一个正确的结论 那么被你删掉的就是多余的 但是如果留下的不是一个好的论证 那你就必须去检查那些被你删掉的词语 以确保它们真的不是合理的 因为你并不总是公允 对于那些你想要对其阐述的人来说 如果你删掉一些 论证中非常重要的部分 

在某些情况下 就变得很棘手了 并不清楚它们是否要被删除 

有些细节是模棱两可的限制词汇 举一个例子 我觉得米兰达在家 所以我们能在那儿与她见面 哪个是限制词？ 当你做了周密分析的时候你可能已经找到了 是吧 我认为 

现在 一种解读这个论证的方式是 前提是 我认为米兰达在家里 结论是我们能在那里见到她 

但是这有点奇怪 因为你认为她在家的事实  并不能使你在那里能遇到她的结果成立 是她在家的事实才可以 使你能在她家碰到她的结果成立 所以如果前提是你认为而 结论是关于她在那里 和你能在哪里见到她 那么这个论证就不能说得通 因此 在这里 我们要删除掉 "我认为”这个词 因为它使得整个论证看起来傻乎乎的 而这个论证真的等于米兰达在家里 所以我们 可以在那里碰到她 而“我认为”包含了句子的全部含义 可以这么说 我认为她在家 所以我认为我们能在那里碰到她 但是论证并未包含涉及“你的想法”的前提 对比一下这是一个完全不同的论证 米兰达在家里 因此我们可能会在那里碰到她 

所以 这里就有另外一个限定词 是吧 有可能 

你能删掉那个么？ 如果那样 论证就变成了 米兰达在家 因此我们能在那里见到她 但是这很明显不是说话的人想说的 如果他们加入“有可能”这个词 他们就 能意识到她在家这个事实 并不能表明我们立马就能在那里见到她 因为可能我们要花一段时间才能到那里 而我们还在路上的时候 她可能就离开了 

所以删掉“有可能”这个词使这个论证变糟 对论证这件事的人来说可能不合理 因此在这种情况下你要保留限制词 以便使论证更有力 因此 看起来有时候 你要保留限定词 而另一些时候 你要删掉它们 而这并没有你能遵守的严格的规则 你需要自己体会 论证尽可能地更好 哪些更适当地体现发言者的意图 另一个技巧是假设词 

假设我正在写一封推荐信 我说 他无疑是一个很棒的工人 我知道是这样的 因此你应该雇佣他 这个假设词是“无疑”和“我知道是这样” 

但是现在问题是 这个论证 的第一个前提 他是无疑是一个很棒的工人 第二前提 我知道是这样的 结论 你应该雇佣他 如果你仔细想想 这又有点奇怪了 因为你还没有雇佣他 因为 这很明显 如果他是一个很棒的工人 但是不是很明显 你仍然应该雇佣他因为他仍然是一个很棒的工人 或者他是一个很棒的工人 但是我不知道他很很棒 你仍然应该雇佣他因为他仍然是一个很棒的工人 我知道的这个事实和你应该雇佣他之间是无关的 因为这仅涉及到我的主观判断而不是他的能力 

因此这个论证的表达方式并没有真的抓住 写推荐信的重点 

因此我们可以删除“我知道是这样”和“无疑” 那么论证就变成 他是一个很棒的工人因此你应该雇佣他 但是与这个不同的例子是 我肯定雅各布正在欺骗他的妻子 

因此我应该去告诉她 现在你可能会认为 我确信这件事也是一个假设词 因此我们可以删掉它 然后真正的论证就变成雅各布欺骗他 妻子 因此我应该去告诉她 但是想想这个论证 仅仅是他对妻子不忠的这个事实并不能 使我觉得应该告诉她 如果我不确信的话 因为如果我有一些怀疑或者我只是猜测但是 我并不真的知道那么我可能不会去告诉雅各布的妻子 雅各布不忠的这件事 所以论证的力度在这里就取决于我的确定性 如果我不确信我就不会告诉她 如果我确信那么我就会 因此我们不能删除假设词 在这种情况下 因为这会扭曲论证的意思 现在 当然 有些人会不同意我的看法 他们会说 好吧 你看 如果你有一些理由但是你不肯定 你是否要去告诉她 那就会变得有争议 但是我们这里谈论的不是那些人会怎么想而是发言者 的想法 给出这个论证的人 当这个人说 我确信 雅各布对他的妻子不忠 他们似乎表明 他们确信 的事实提供了一个更好的理由  为什么他应该去告诉雅各布的妻子 因此 如果我们 想要抓住这个人论证的含义 在这种情况下 我们就必须保留假设词 我们已经看过了一个你应该去掉假设词的例子 和一个你应该保留假设词的例子 和限定词一样  不存在能应用于所有情况的标准规则 你必须自己想清楚再决定 是去掉这些词使论证扭曲呢 还是去掉这些词使论证更好 由于删除冗余废话的重点就是 去掉那些无关紧要的东西 但保留构成好论证的所有必不可少的词语 都是必不可少的 最后 当我们去掉所有的废话后 剩下的是什么呢？ 答案是 论证中明确的的前提和结论 去除废话的关键 在于将论证中的关键部分提取出来 的重要部分 那些论证的基础 形式 从所有不必要的词语中 当然 我们仍然需要决定哪些 是前提 哪些是结论 对吧? 这就是为什么周密分析有用 因为我们表明 哪些是原因哪些是结果 让你标识出哪些是 前提 哪个是结论 因此现在 我们可以 做第三步 我们能把论证放到标准形式里面 我们把前提放在上一行 我们用点和句号结束 结论放在下一行 然后我们就把论证变成标准形式了 也完成了重构任务的第二阶段 在这个阶段 最好回头去看看文本 看你是否 删掉了所有废话 所有不是论证基础结构的废话 你可以看文本里是否保留了 标准形式里的前提和结论 如果有一些在文本中 如果文本中有些内容没有被涉及 你应该确认 这部分内容是否 是多余的 

而且当然这个论证同时看起来很糟糕 你就必须回去看看是否遗漏 了一些你视为冗余废话的内容 但是其实却是论证的关键部分 因此 我们可以利用形式标准化的这个流程 来检验 我们在之前的阶段 是否正确地删除了冗余词语 因此 第二步和 第三步在着手处理基础部分的阶段是连在一起的  这就是帮助我们运用这些不同部分 来验证我们是否做对了的方法 

### sharpen edges

We're right in the middle of reconstruction. We did stage one last week, because that's just close analysis. In the previous lecture, we did stage two, which is to remove excess verbiage and to put the explicit premises and conclusion into standard form. And this lecture is going to focus on stage three. Which is to clarify the premises, and to break them up where possible, without distorting them. Let's start with step 4, which is to clarify the premises and the conclusion when it's needed. So we might need to clarify them, just in order to make them easier to understand. Or to make them less likely to mislead. And. All that sounds pretty good. So let's try on this example. 

It was hot today, so it will probably be hot tomorrow again. Now we need to clarify that. What exactly counts as today? Is that you know, the time when there's daylight? Well, does it also include night? Even though night is not day. And what exactly do we mean by hot? How hot was it today? And how hot will it be tomorrow? And what, after all, is heat? And what about, it'll probably be hot tomorrow? Probability. That's a tough notion. We're going to spend a whole week on that later on in the course. There are different kinds of probability. I want to know what kinds you're talking about here and when you ask, for example about, will it be hot tomorrow? What is, what is will mean? It means it's going to happen in the future. And what exactly is the future and is the future real, is time real? You can go a long way towards asking how to clarify that argument. 

But that's ridiculous. You know, we don't have to clarify a simple argument like, it was hot today, so it will probably be hot tomorrow. And it's lucky we don't have to clarify every word in the argument because you couldn't. After all when you explain one of the words or give a definition for it, its going to be in terms of other words, and they have to be clarified and you will never get to the end of it. 

The search for perfect clarity and absolute precision is impossible. You will never complete that search. You will never find perfect clarity or absolute precision. So give it up. What we should seek is not absolute precision but adequate precision, not absolute clarity but adequate clarity and that means that we ought to try to clear up those parts of the premises and conclusions that are likely to produce confusion later. You have to be able to kind of predict, whether this part of the argument needs to be clarified, because people are going to get confused by it. Now, that's not going to be easy, and there's no simple or mechanical rule to tell you what needs to be clarified and what doesn't need to be clarified. The only way to learn this skill. Is to go through some examples that'll give you models of what needs to be clarified and what done. Sometimes the unclarity lies in a single word. In the 1980s, Nancy Reagan used to say, "Just say 'No' to drugs". What does that mean? Well, she is telling you not to use drugs. To say no when somebody offers you drugs or tries to tell you to use drugs. So in effect she's saying, you ought not to use drugs. 

That's pretty clear, but now what does she mean by drugs? 

Does she mean Aspirin? 

I don't think she's telling me not to use Aspirin? Does she mean prescription drugs? I don't think she's telling me not to follow the advice of your doctor and use the prescriptions that the doctor told you to take. 

So that can't be what she means. Well maybe she means illegal drugs. 

Okay. Maybe she means illegal drugs. What about heroin or cocaine? Yes, that's what she's telling you not to do. She's definitely telling you not to take illegal drugs. 

But then there's somethings in the middle. She might be telling you not to take dangerous drugs, whether they're illegal or not. What about. Nicotine. What about alcohol? Those are both dangerous drugs. At least when you used to excess, alcohol is very dangerous and smoking can lead to lung cancer and that's how most people get nicotine. So maybe she's telling you not to take nicotine or alcohol in addition to illegal drugs like heroine and cocaine. Now it's not clear. So how do we clear it up? Well, you want Nancy Reagan's claim to look as good as possible. Remember, you're always trying to make the argument look as good as possible. And one way to make it look good is to make your claim no more than she has to claim. So, she could be claiming that in addition to heroin and cocaine, you shouldn't take alcohol and nicotine, but probably or at at least more [INAUDIBLE] she's telling you not to take illegal drugs. She had to choose between interpret her as saying don't take any illegal drugs and don't take any dangerous drugs. And it seems like the more charitable interpretation that makes her claim look more plausible is don't take any illegal drugs. So we could clarify her claim, just say "No" to drug, by interpreting it to mean you ought not to take any illegal drugs. So in general then, the lesson is. That, when there are options about how to clarify a certain sentence, we ought to pick the most charitable option that makes the claim look as good as possible. 

Here's another example, where the unclarity can be traced to a single word, but in this case it's the word that, and it's not clear what it refers to. So imagine that someone argues like this. They say, she claims that our strategy won't work because the enemy knows our plan. But that is a big mistake. 

What is that refer to? That could refer to, that is the word that could refer to, 

that the enemy knows our plan. Someone says, that's a mistake, they might be saying it's a mistake to think that the enemy knows our plan, but it could refer to the claim that our strategy won't work. They could be saying it's a mistake to think our strategy won't work or they could be saying, but the mistake is to think that the enemy knowing our plan, is enough to make it not work. 

They might be saying, it's not that it won't work because the enemy knows the plan. Or, here's a fourth possibility. 

They could be saying, that is a mistake to think that she claims that. That's not what she claims. 

So, there're four different ways to interpret this argument. 

And in order to figure out how to interpret it we have to figure out, which of those is most likely as an interpretation of what the arguer is trying to say. And that's going to depend on which one makes the argument look the best. Now in this example, it's not clear which interpretation is the best because someone might give that argument in a context where they're saying the mistake is to think she claims that, but in other cases they might be saying that the mistake is to think that the enemy knows our plan. They don't really know our plan. And in other cases, they might be claiming that other things, you're mistaken. So, we need to figure out what the person is saying, but that could depend on the particular context and might vary from context to context. Now, these unclarities seem unintentional. But sometimes people use unclarity. To hide problems with their argument. To try to fool you. So imagine a politician says, we need to stop our enemies and stand by our friends. So we must remain strong and resolute. 

Well, if somebody starts arguing like that you ought to be asking yourself. Who do they think our friends are? Who do they think our enemies are? What do they mean, stop our enemies? Are they calling for military action? How do they think we ought to stop our enemies? And standing by our friends, does that mean we ought to support them no matter what they do? There're lots of questions that you would want to ask to clarify exactly which claim is being made before you accept something like this. Heres another claim that might be made by an opponent of a first politician. "We have to help the needy," wait a minute. 

Which people are needy? I mean everybody needs something. How needy do you have to be to be needy? And, we ought to help the needy? Well, how are we going to help them? Does that mean we just give them whatever they want? Or, what are we supposed to give them, and when are we supposed to give them, and how much are we willing to spend on giving it to them? Politicians on both sides of the political spectrum make vague claims that need to be clarified. Before you should be willing to endorse one or the other of those claims. If you try to decide, what to believe before you know exactly what the claim means, before you've clarified it, you could end up committing yourself to all kinds of nonsense and all kinds of very problematic positions. You could get yourself into a lot of trouble. That's why we need to clarify the terms in arguments. 

Now, one special way in which premises need to be clarified, is that they need to be broken up into smaller parts, where you can do that. And the point of this is that the smaller parts are going to be easier to understand, and easier to access whether they are true or not. So step 4, clarify the premises, belongs together with step 5, break up the premises into parts. What needs to be broken up? Well, the explicit premises and sometimes the conclusion, as well. Here's a simple example. 

That shirt looks great on you and it's on sale. So you ought to buy it. We might put that in standard form like this. That shirt looks great on you and, it's on sale, is the premise. And the conclusion is, you ought to buy it. But notice, that the premise has two parts, joined by an and. So, we could break them up. And have the first premise, that shirt looks great on you, and the second premise, it's on sale. And then the conclusion is, you ought to buy it. Breaking it up like that is supposed to make it easier to asses the premise for truth or falsehood. Now in this case it doesn't make it much easier, because it was so simple to begin with, but we'll see that breaking up premises will really help when we get to more complex examples. 

So, it makes sense to break up premises. Well, at least sometimes. We should not break up premises when breaking them up distorts the argument. Here's an example of that. 

We still need to add either one more cup of white sugar or one more cup of brown sugar to complete the recipe, so we've gotta add another cup of ingredients. 

Then one way to represent that argument would be to say that premises, we still need to add either one more cup of white sugar or one more cup of brown sugar and the conclusion is, we have another cup of ingredients to add. 

But we could break it up because it's got parts. We could change the argument into, we still need to add one more cup of white sugar. That's the first premise. And the second premise is, we still need to add one more cup of brown sugar and then the conclusion is, we have one more cup of ingredients to add, but that argument doesn't make any sense. If we've got to add one of white and one of brown, we don't just have one more cup of ingredients to add. And as always, we're supposed to be making the argument look good. And that change made it look bad. And the problem is that here, we broke up the word or. Because it's one cup of white or one cup of brown. And presumably you didn't know which it was or maybe you had a choice between the two. But you weren't suppose to both. That would be too much. And the word or signals that. So, in general, you should not break up, when the word that joins the two is or, but it's okay to break up when the word that joins the two is and. You still gotta be careful about context, it's not always going to work that way, but as a general rule. You know, that usually works. Other cases are even trickier. One particularly problematic case is dependent clauses. 

Here's an example. 

Nancy finished all her homework because all she had to do was write 25 lines of poetry, and she wrote two sonnets which have 14 lines each. The dependent clause is, which have 14 lines each. And the question is, how do we fit that into standard form? Well, here's one stab. The first premise can say, all she had to do is write 25 lines of poetry. And the second premise can be, she wrote two sonnets which have 14 lines each. And then the conclusion is, Nancy finished all her homework. Now the question is, can we break up that second premise into two different parts, and it seems like we can. We should be able to represent the argument so the first premise is, all she had to do was write 25 lines of poetry and the second premise says she wrote two sonnets, and the third premise says sonnets have 14 lines each, and the conclusion is, she finished all her homework. In this case, breaking down the premise actually helps us understand and assess it. Because we can decide whether it's really true, for example, that sonnets have 14 lines each. That's going to be a question. If the answer is no, then the argument might fail. If the answer is yes, at least for standard sonnets, so the argument looks pretty good. Contrast that example with this one. 

Our legal system isn't fair, because authorities go easy on white collar criminals who have been allowed to get away with their crimes in recent years. Well the premise could be authorities go easy on criminals who have been allowed to get away with their crimes in recent years, and the conclusion is our legal system isn't fair. 

Now the question is can we break up that first premise. because it has that deep ended clause who have been allowed to get away with their crimes in recent years. Well, that depends. Because the person giving the argument might be saying that authorities go easy on all white collar criminals. And they might be saying, that authorities only go easy on a certain subset of white-collar criminals. Namely, the subset that have been allowed to get away with their crimes in recent years. 

If the premise is about all white-collar criminals, then we can break it up. 

So that one premise says, authorities go easy on white-collar criminals. And the next premise says, white-collar criminals have been allowed to get away with their crimes in recent years. 

But if the arguer is only talking about some white-collar criminals. And admits that other white-collar criminals have not been allowed to get away with their crime. He's only saying that. Authorities go easy on those white-collar criminals who have been allowed to get away with their crime. That subset of white-collar criminals and then it would distort the argument to break it up, because if you do break it up, then that second premise says white-collar criminals have been allowed to get away with their crimes in recent years. And if some of 'em haven't, then that premise turns out to be false. 

So if you break it up, you can criticize it by pointing out that it doesn't really apply to all white-collar criminals. But if you leave it as a single premise, then it's not subject to that criticism. So, if you want to be charitable. You probably ought to keep this premise together, unless you know on independent grounds, that the person was making that claim about all white-collar criminals, and not just a subset. So, to make that argument look better, we don't break up the premise. And the general lesson is that with dependent clauses like that, and which, and who. You have to look very carefully to figure out what the speaker wanted to say and what's going to make their argument look best and use that information to determine whether or not to break up the premise. There are no airtight rules as always, so we needed a few exercises to practice this skill. 

我们已经在重建论证了 我们上周做了阶段一 那只不过是周密分析  而上节课中 我们进展到了阶段二 这一步要求我们精炼俭省 将前提和结论明提炼成标准格式 这一讲我们会关注阶段三 这要求我们阐明前提 在不歪曲意思的基础上 将前提条件分解 来吧让我们从了解它的开始吧 从第4步开始 我们在必要时需阐明前提和结论 阐明是为了使它们更易于理解 或使它们不太会被误解 听上去不难 那么我们来看看这个例子 

“今天很热 那么明天可能也很热” 我们现在 想要阐明 今天指的是什么？ 是指一天中的白天时段？ 还是包含夜晚？ 即便夜晚并不是白天 而我们所指的热又是什么？ 今天有多热？  明天又将有多热？ 而且热度究竟是什么? 并且 明天可能很热又是几个意思？  说到可能性 这是个难题 在后面的课程中 我们将用一周来讨论可能性 有很多种不同的可能性  我想知道你说的是哪一种 例如 当你问我明天会热吗？ 你说的“会”指什么？ 它意味着情况将在未来发生 而未来到底是什么？ 未来是真实的吗？时间是真实的吗？  你要费上好多精力 来研究怎样阐述这个论证 

但这很荒谬 我们没必要去解释这种简单论证 比如今天天气很热 因此明天或许也会很热 我们没必要去解释论证中的每一个词 因为我们也做不到 毕竟 当你解释一个词或给它下定义时 肯定会用到其他的词汇 如果那些词汇也需要解释 那你永远也解释不完 

追求完美和绝对的精准是不可能的 你永远做不到 既然无法找到完美或绝对精准的解释 还是别钻牛角尖 我们要追求的不是绝对精准而是足够精准 不是绝对清晰而是足够清晰 所以我们需要试着理清这些前提和结论 以免之后会引起迷惑和误解 你得能预测出  论证中需要得到说明的地方 因为人们有可能在这些地方感到困惑 要做到并不容易 而且也没有简单死板的规则 来告诉你何处需要说明或不需要说明 学会这个技能的唯一方法 就是练习一些案例  它们将展示那些需要说明的疑点 有时候 使人困惑的只是一个词 在二十世纪八十年代（1980s） 南希·里根（Nancy Reagan）常说 “对药（drugs）说不” 这是什么意思？ 其实 她是在说不要使用药（drugs） 拒绝那些给你“药” 或者要你去用“药”的人 所以实际上 她是说你不应该用“药” 

这很清楚 但她说的“药”（drugs）到底指什么？ 

她是指阿司匹林吗？ 

我认为 她不是要我不去用阿司匹林 那么她说的是处方药吗？ 我觉得 她不是要我们不听医嘱 不用医生开的处方药 

所以那些都不是她本意 她指的是非法药品喽？ 

没错 也许她指的是非法药品 海洛因和可卡因？没错 这才是她告诫的本意 她肯定是要你拒绝非法药品 

但其中存在一些含混之处 她可能是在告诉你 不要使用危险的药物 不管它是否合法 比如 尼古丁 比如酒精 都是危险的药品 至少过量使用酒精 是非常危险的 并且吸烟会导致肺癌 很多人因尼古丁 患上烟瘾 所以她也许是说 除了海洛因可卡因这类非法药品 不要使用尼古丁或者酒精 这样说并不明晰 那么我们如何说明白呢？ 要让南希·里根的话听上去尽量清楚明白 记着 你得一直让她的话足够清楚明白 要做到这点 你的解释就不能超出她的本意 所以她可能说 除了海洛因和可卡因 你也不应该用酒精和尼古丁 假设对健康食品很偏执的 格雷格·曼德尔(Greg Mandela)［无声］ 她的意思会是 不要服用非法药品 她的本意非此即彼 要么是拒绝使用非法药品 要么是拒绝使用危险药品 使南希慈善口号听上去最合理的解释应该是 不要使用任何非法药品 所以我们明白了她的意思 是“对非法药品说不” 其实就是不要使用任何非法药品 所以总的来说 这门课就是 我们应选择最恰当的解释 让论证尽可能恰当合理 

另外还有一个例子  它的一个词造成了语义模糊 这个例子里 “那个（that）” 指代不明 那么如果 那么为什么这些结论如此重要呢像这样的金融危机的发生 “她声称我们的战略是不会成功的 因为敌人知道我们的计划” 这么说就大错特错了 

这句话中的“那”（that）指什么？ “那”可以指 

“敌人知道我们的计划” 有人觉得不对 他们认为"那"可能并不是指 “敌人知道我们的计划” “那”也有可能指“我们的策略不会成功” 有些人会说 “认为我们的策略不会成功”本身就是错的 或者他们会这样说 但是光是“认为敌人知道我们的计划”的推断 就大错特错 

他们会说 失败的原因 不是因为”敌人知道我们的计划“ 这里还有第四种可能 

他们是说 这句话不能理解为是”她的声明“ “她”并没有做那样的声明 

因此 有四种不同的方式来解读这个论证 

为了能找到正确的理解 我们需要弄清楚 哪一种解读 更符合论证者的本意 那将取决于 那个能推出最恰当论证的解释 在这个例子中 我们无法肯定哪一种解读是最恰当的 因为有人会从语境出发 认为 不该理解为是”她“说的话 在其他的情况下 有人会认为 敌人知道这个计划 然而敌人并不知道我们真正的计划 在其它的情况下 有人或许又会说你理解错了 而我们需要弄清那人的本意 这取决于特定的上下文 语境不同 意思也就不同 这些含混似乎并非有意 但有人会利用这种含混语义 来回避问题 或者愚弄你 假如一个政客说 我们要阻止敌人 支持朋友 因此我们需要保持坚强和果敢 

那么如果有人做出如此论证 你应该问自己 他们认为我们的朋友是谁？ 他们认为我们的敌人又是谁？ “阻止我们的敌人”意味着什么？ 这是在呼吁采取军事行动吗？ 他们认为我们应当怎样阻止敌人？ 而支持朋友 是否意味着 我们要无条件支持他们？ 在你接受他们的言论前 你会想问很多问题去彻底搞清他们的言论 政客一的对手或许会这样声明 “我们需要帮助穷人”  

哪些人是穷人？ 我是说每个人都有匮乏之处 多穷才算穷？ 我们一定要帮助他们吗？ 那么 我们又将如何帮助他们？ 他们想要什么我们都给吗？  或者说 我们应该给他们什么？在什么时候给？ 我们愿意为他们投入多少金钱？ 在你愿意支持 左右各派政客的言论之前 他们模糊的言论都需要得到阐明 如果你还未确认言论本意 就试图去决定相信 最终 你将会深陷 各种荒谬的言论和矛盾重重的立场 你会给自己带来很多麻烦 这就是我们要用论证阐释它们的原因 

一种阐明前提的特殊方法就是 有必要时 把它们分解得更小 这么做是为了 让细节更容易被理解 让它们的真假也更容易评估 第4步 阐明前提 是第5步的一部分 第5步是 将前提分解 哪些需要被分解呢？ 有时是明确的前提 有时是结论 举一个简单的例子 

那件衬衣你穿着很合适 而且正在促销 所以你应该买下它 我们可以将这论证代入标准格式 那件衬衣很适合你 而且正在促销 是前提 你应该买它 是结论 但需要注意的是 前提包含两个部分 它们由“和”（and）连接起来  因此我们可以 将它们分解如下 第一个前提是 衬衣很适合你 第二个前提是 它正在促销 结论是 你应该买这件衬衣 这样分解成分 能降低判断前提真假的难度 在这个例子中 我们并没让判断更容易 因为它已经够简单了 但在接下来我们会看到 对前提的分解 会帮助我们解决更复杂的案例 

所以至少在某些情况下 分解前提是有意义的 如果分解会导致论证曲解 则不该分解前提 比如说 

如果需要多加一杯白糖或一杯红糖才能完成食材配比 那么我们还需要再加一杯原料才完整 

因此 这个论证的一种表达方式是 “我们仍需要添加一杯 白糖或是红糖”是前提 “所以我们需要再加一杯原料”是结论 

但我们可以分解这个论证 因为它有多个部分 我们可以把这个论证变成 “我们仍需要加一杯白糖” 这是前提一 前提二是 “我们仍需要加一杯红糖” 而结论是 “还有一杯原料需要添加 ” 但这样一来 论证就不合理了 如果我们需要加入一杯白糖和一杯红糖  我们需要的就不只是一杯原料了 而与往常一样 我们希望能让论证看起来更恰当 而这个改变使它变糟糕了 问题在于  我们把词句拆散了 或者说 分解后变成了 一杯白糖“或”一杯红糖 也许你并不清楚究竟选哪一种 也许你早已想好要用哪一种 但你不能两者兼取 那样就太多糖了  “或者”就显示出了这么多意思 因此 总的来说 当两者的连接词是“或者”时 你不应该把它们分解 当两者由“和”连接时 你可以将它们分解 你仍然需要注意上下文 作为一个普遍规则 它并不总能适用所有情况 如你所知 一般规则通常是有效的 但有些情形是更棘手的  一个麻烦的例子是从属子句 

举一个例子 

南希做完了她的家庭作业 因为她所需要做的 是写25行诗 而她写了 两首每首诗有14句的十四行诗 在这里 从属子句是 “每首诗有十四句” 而问题是 我们如何把它们套入格式标准中？ 这里有一种尝试 第一个前提是 她需要做的 是写25行诗 第二个条件是 她写了两首每首诗14句的十四行诗 因此 结论是 南希完成了她的家庭作业 现在 问题是我们能 把第二个前提分成两部分吗？ 应该做得到 我们应该能表达这个论证 所以第一个前提是 她只写25行诗就够了 第二个前提是 她写了两首十四行诗 第三个是 每首十四行诗有都有14行 因此结论是 她完成了家庭作业 在这种情况下 分解前提 事实上帮助我们理解与评估了前提 因为我们可以断定 结论是否为真 例如 每首十四行诗都有14行 这里需要提问 如果答案为否 那么论证或许会失败 如果答案为真 至少当我们提到的是标准的十四行诗时 那这个论证是很恰当的 以下举的例子 和上一个例子相反 

我们的法律制度不是很公平 因为权力部门对白领阶层罪犯更加宽松 近几年 他们甚至脱离罪责 那么 这个前提可以是权力部门 对罪犯太宽松  以至于这几年他们能逃脱罪责 结论是我们的法律系统不公平 

现在的问题是 我们可以分离 第一个前提吗？ 它的结尾有一个复杂的从句 可以摆脱罪责 这要看情况 因为给出这个论证的人可能是在说 当权者对所有的白领罪犯都太宽松了 但这也可能是在说 当权者只对 一部分白领罪犯太宽松 就是说他们就是这几年 被宽松对待的那些罪犯 

如果前提是在说所有的白领罪犯 那么我们就能分解前提 

所以一个前提是 当权者对白领罪犯很宽松 领一个前提是 白领犯罪这些年被从宽 可以摆脱罪责 

但如果这个论证仅仅是在讲一部分白领罪犯 并且承认 其他白领罪犯并没有 被免罪 他只是在说 当权者对那些被免于罪责的 白领罪犯很宽松 如果是说一部分白领罪犯的话 那么这个分解后的论证 就被歪曲了 因为 如果你分离了这个前提 那么第二个前提就是在说 白领罪犯在近几年可以逃脱他们的罪责 但只要有一些人并没有逃脱罪责 那这个前提就为假了 

那么 如果你分离了前提 你就可以指出 它的错误 也就是并非所有的白领罪犯都可以逃脱罪责 但是如果你不打算分解它 那么你就不能这么评判 所以 如果你想要说得清楚一点 你可以完整的保留这个前提 除非你知道 这个人的确是在说 所有的白领罪犯 而不是其中的一部分 所以为了让这个论证看起来更恰当 我们不会分解这个前提 主要的教训就是 在很多附属从句里面 比如taht, which 和who 你必须非常仔细 才能弄清楚说者想要表达什么 从而决定要不要分离前提 让这个论证看起来更恰当 这没有一个固定的方法 所以我们需要做一些练习来训练这个技能 

### organize parts

Welcome back. We've covered stages one through three of argument reconstruction. Namely, close analysis, get down to basics, and sharpen edges. In this lecture, we'll cover stage four. Which is organized parts. because it's not enough to isolate the parts and figure out what they are. You need to show how they fit together in a structure, so that they work together to support the conclusion of the argument. 

To see how this works, let's start with an example. 

Consider this example. That fertilizer won't help the roses bloom, because there's already a lot of nitrogen in the soil. So the fertilizer will make the nitrogen levels too high. Of course, so is a conclusion marker. So one conclusion is that, the fertilizer will make the nitrogen levels too high. 

And then you might think that one might have put the argument into standard form goes like this. Premise one is, that fertilizer won't make the roses bloom. Premise two is, the nitrogen levels in the soil are already high. And then the conclusion is, that the fertilizer will make the nitrogen levels too high. But that doesn't really make any sense if you think about it. How could the fact that the roses won't bloom, be a reason to believe that the nitrogen levels are too high? 

This couldn't be a reason for that, so we must have the wrong structure. However, there's another argument marker. This time it's a premise marker. Because. 

And that indicates that the claim that there's already a lot of nitrogen in the soil is a premise, but what's the conclusion for that premise. That's supposed to show that the fertilizer won't make the roses bloom. 

So we've missed that part of the structure. If we put it in standard form the way we first thought. The trick here is that there is really two conclusions. 

One conclusion is that the fertilizer won't help the roses bloom. And another conclusion is that the fertilizer will make the nitrogen levels too high, but each argument is supposed to have just one conclusion. 

So how are we going to put this into a structure? The solution is that there are two arguments. One is that the nitrogen levels in the soil are already high. Therefore, adding the fertilizer will make them too high. And the second argument is that. Adding the fertilizer will make the nitrogen levels too high. Therefore, the fertilizer will not make the roses bloom. 

Now notice that one argument really builds on the other, because the conclusion of the first argument is really a premise in the second argument. 

So we can represent them as two separate arguments, but we can also put them together in a chain. So that the argument says, the nitrogen levels in the soil are already high, therefore adding fertilizer will make them too high. And therefore, adding fertilizer will not help the roses bloom. 

Now, if we take that whole structure, and we try to represent it in a diagram, and we represent each premise with a number. Which is the number that was given it in the standard form, then we can simply have premise one. With an arrow to premise two indicating that premise one is a reason for premise two. And then another arrow going from premise two to premise three to indicate that two is a reason for three. 

In a way, we've got two premises and two conclusions because, that one claim in the middle, number two, operates as a conclusion in the first argument, and premise in the second argument. 

But overall, I hope the diagram makes it clear why I want to call this a linear structure. When you have one premise giving a reason for a conclusion, which is then a premise for another conclusion. Then they form a line when you diagram them in the way that I'm proposing. 

Arguments can have other structures too. In particular, sometimes there's more than one premise associated with a single conclusion. And this can happen in two ways. The first we're going to call the branching structure. And the second we're going to call the joint structure. 

Here's an example of the branching structure. 

I'm not going to go to the movie with you because I don't like horror flicks. And besides, I'm too busy. The word because is a premise marker. So that indicates that the conclusion is that I'm not going to go to the movie with you. And there are two premises. One is I don't like horror flicks, and the other is I'm too busy. 

Now you might think that, that could just be put in the old linear structure that we already saw. But then the argument's going to look like this. 

I don't like horror flicks therefore, I'm too busy, therefore, I'm not going to go to the movie. But wait a minute. The fact that I don't like horror flicks doesn't mean I'm too busy. That doesn't make any sense. Oh, maybe it's the other way around. I'm too busy, therefore, I don't like horror flicks, therefore, I'm not going to go to that movie with you. 

That didn't make any sense either. The fact that I'm too busy isn't why I don't like horror flicks. The problem is there are two premises here, but neither one is a reason for the other, as we saw on the linear structure. Instead, in this branching structure, each premise is operating independently. There's one argument. I don't like horror flicks, therefore I'm not going to go to that movie with you. There's another argument. I'm too busy, therefore I'm not going to go to that movie with you. And each premise by itself is a sufficient reason not to go to the movie with you. I mean just think about it. If I wasn't too busy but I didn't like horror flicks, I wouldn't go to the movie. But if I liked horror flicks but I was too busy, then I still wouldn't go to the movie. So each premise itself, is enough and they operate independently. 

That's what makes this a branching structure, instead of a linear structure. 

Lets diagram it and you will see why we call it a branching structure. One way to diagram it would be simply draw an arrow between premise one and conclusion two, and then there's a separate argument, so you draw another arrow from one star, another premise to conclusion two. And that's okay, but notice that it doesn't show you that both premises are reasons for the same conclusion. So to capture that aspect of the structure, that both premise one and premise one star support the same conclusion, namely two, it's better to diagram it so that. There's an arrow that runs independently from both premises to a single instance of conclusion two, as you see in the diagram on the screen. 

And that should show you why we're calling it a branching structure, because it kind of branches, it looks like the branches of a tree. Okay, it doesn't really look like the branches of a tree, but you get the idea. We're going to call it a branching structure. Next, we have to separate this branching structure from what we're going to call the joint structure. The difference is that in the branching structure the premises provide independent support for the conclusion. Whereas in this joint structure, they work together. And they're not going to have force independent of each other. It's like the joint in your leg. Which joins together the calf with the thigh. And if you didn't have both, it wouldn't work very well. So we're going to call it a joint structure. Here's an example. 

For my birthday, my wife always gives me either a sweater or a board game. This box does not contain a sweater. So, this time she must have given me a board game. Now notice that the argument marker, so, indicates that the conclusion is this time she must have given me a board game. And it's got two premises. And you might think that they got a linear structure, and the argument goes something like this. My wife always give me a sweater or a board game. Therefore, this box does not contain a sweater. Therefore, this time she gave me a board game. That didn't make any sense, right? I mean the fact that she always give me a sweater or a board game gives me no reason to believe that this box doesn't contain a sweater. Well, okay, let's try it again. Maybe it's a branching structure. That would mean that the argument looks like this. 

My wife always gives me either a sweater or a board game. Therefore, this time she gave me a board game. And as a separate argument, this box does not contain a sweater. Therefore, this time she must have given me a board game. Neither of those arguments makes any sense. So it can't be a branching structure. 

Instead what we have here is the two premises working together. She always gives me either a sweater or a board game. And, the second premise, this box does not contain a sweater. Those two premises have to work together. It's only jointly working together that they can support their conclusion this time she must have given me a board game. How can we diagram this joint structure. 

We can put, a plus sign between premiss one and premiss two. Then draw a line under them to show that they work together, jointly. 

And take a line from that line, and draw an arrow down to the conclusion, just like in the diagram. And this is what we're going to call the joint structure. So, we've seen the linear structure, the branching structure, and the joint structure. And we can combine more than one of these structures into a single argument. To see how to do this, let's just do a slide variation on the previous example. My wife always gives me either a sweater or a board game. This box does not contain a sweater. Because it rattles when I shake it. So, this time she must have given me a board game. 

This argument combined a linear structure with a joint structure. 

There are two argument markers. One's a conclusion marker, so and that indicates that the eventual conclusion is that she must of given me a board game this time. But there's also that new word because, which indicates that the fact that it rattles when I shake it, means that it's not a sweater. So the first stage if the argument in standard form looks like this. Premise one, this box rattles when I shake it. Therefore, conclusion, this box does not contain a sweater. 

Stage two says this box does not contain a sweater. My wife always gives me either a sweater or a board game. So the conclusion, this time she must have given me a board game. 

And of course, the conclusion of that first little argument. Is identical with the premise of the second argument. So we can put them together into a chain. We can say, this box rattles when I shake it, so it must not contain a sweater. My wife always gives me a sweater or a board game so, this time she must have given me a board game. That's how we get a linear structure, combined with a joint structure. And we can use our diagram methods to diagram this argument the same way we did before. We simply start with premise one, the box rattles when I shake it, drawn an arrow down to its conclusion, namely, the box does not contain a sweater. That's two, and then we show that those are joint by adding a plus premise three, mainly, my wife always gives me either a sweater or a board game. Draw a line under them and an arrow from those two together, down to the eventual conclusion namely, four. That this time she must have given me a board game. 

The fact that the top arrow goes from premise one to two, but does not go from premise one to three, indicates that, that premise is a reason for two, but is not a reason for three. So when you use this method to diagram arguments, you have to be careful where you draw the arrows. And draw them only where there really is a rational connection. That is where one claim is being presented as a reason for that particular claim that the arrow's pointing towards. Now almost all arguments can be diagrammed using these three simple structures, that is the linear structure, the branching structure, the joint structure, and some combination of those three. You can add more premises, because you can always add one plus two plus three plus four. If there are four premises operating together in a joint structure. And you can add extra arrows if you have a branch with more than two branches, so you can cover a lot of arguments using these kinds of diagrams. The method can be described in general like this. You start by identifying the premises and the conclusions, and you number them. So that you can just have numbers instead of having to write out the whole sentence on the diagram. Then when they work together, you put a plus sign between them and draw a line under it to indicate that they're working together, they're functioning as a group. Then, you draw an arrow from the claims that are reasons to the claims that they are reasons for. 

And then you move them around on the diagram so that they form a line when it's a linear structure, and branches when it's a branching structure. That'll be easy to rearrange them. So as to show how all of the different premises, and conclusions work together in a single argumentative structure. 

That's going to be enough to accomplish this stage of reconstruction, namely to organize the parts and show how they work together in the overall argument. 

欢迎回来 至此我们完成了重建论证的三个阶段 即 细致分析 夯实基础以及明晰概念 这一讲我们说说第四步 即有条理的组成部分 因为仅仅独立分析各部分是不够的 你需要从结构上显示各组成部分 看它们是如何配合以支持论证结论的 

为了方便理解 我们先看一个例子 

揣度这个例子请考虑下面这个案例 肥料不会帮助玫瑰开花 因为 土壤里已经有了大量的氮 所以肥料会使土壤含氮量过高 当然 这是一个结论标记 所以我们可以得出一个结论 肥料将使含氮量过高 

然后你也许会想 标准格式的论证 看起来应该这样 前提一是 肥料不会使玫瑰开花 前提二是 土壤含氮量已经很高 然后结论是 肥料将使含氮量变得过高 但是 只要你认真想想你就会发现这没道理 “玫瑰不开花”怎么能作为 “土壤含氮量过高”的理由呢 

这不能成为理由 所以一定是我们的结构错了 但还有另一个论证标记 它是前提标记“因为” 

这说明“土壤中已经有大量氮” 是个前提 但是这个前提的结论在哪儿呢 结论应该是“肥料不会让玫瑰开花” 

说明我们的结构中缺失这一部分 如果置之于我们一开始的标准格式 问题是 这样会出现两个结论 

一个结论是“肥料不会帮助玫瑰开花” 另一个是“肥料会使含氮量过高” 但是每个论证都应只有一个结论 

那么怎样将它呈现在结构中呢 方法就是分成两个论证 一个是“土壤含氮量已经很高” 因此 “肥料会使含氮量过高” 第二个论证是 “肥料会使含氮量过高” 因此 "肥料不会使 玫瑰开花" 

可以注意到 其实一个论证是以另一个为基础的 因为第一个论证的结论 恰恰是第二个论证的前提 

所以我们可以把他们看成两个独立的论证 但我们也可以把它们贯穿起来 所以当论证一说 “土壤中的含氮量 已经很高了”  因此“施肥会使含氮量过高” 也因此“施肥不会帮助玫瑰开花” 

现在如果我们试用图示表达整个结构  并且用数字标记前提 即在标准格式里标记数字 那我们就可以轻易得出前提一 指向前提二的箭头说明 前提一是前提二的原因 由前提二指向前提三的箭头 表示前提二是前提三的原因 

于是有了两个前提和结论 因为中间的那句 二号句子充当第一个论证的结论  以及第二个论证的前提 

但总的说 我希望通过图示你会明白 我称之为线性结构的原因 当一个前提作为一个结论做理由 且这结论又是下一个结论的前提时 像我一样用图表示 它们就会形成线状 

论证也可以有其它结构 尤其是 有时一个结论 有不止一个的前提的时候 这种情况下 就会出现两种结构 一种我们称其为树形结构 另一种我们称其为耦合型结构 

以下是一个树型结构的例子 

“我不会陪你看电影 因为我不喜欢恐怖片” “而且我很忙” "因为"是前提标记 由此可得到结论 “我不会陪你看电影” 这里有两个前提 一是“我不喜欢恐怖片” 二是“我很忙” 

你也许会想 这也能放进之前的线性结构啊 但这样一来这个论证就会变成 

因为“我不喜欢恐怖片”  所以“我很忙” 所以 “我不会陪你看电影“ 但是别急 不喜欢恐怖片 并不意味着我很忙 这不合逻辑 那么换一种排序呢 因为“我很忙” 所以“我不喜欢恐怖片” 所以"我不会陪你看电影" 

这也不合逻辑 "我很忙"并不是"我不喜欢恐怖片"的原因 问题就是两个前提互不为彼此的理由 这无法用线性结构表现 然而这个树型结构中的每个前提都有独立作用 一个论证是 我不喜欢恐怖片 因此我不会陪你看那部电影 另一个是 我很忙 因此我不会陪你看电影 每个前提都能充分说明不去看电影的理由 好好想想看 如果我不是很忙 但因为我不喜欢恐怖片 我就不会去看电影 另一种情况是 如果我喜欢恐怖片 但我很忙 我仍然不会去 看电影 所以每个前提本身就足以独立发挥作用 

这就说明了为何论证应是树型而非线性结构 

让我们用图示来说明 这样你就明白为何是树型了 一种方法就是简单地 从一个前提画箭头到结论二 这就形成一个独立的论证了  然后从另一个前提画箭头到结论二 图示就完成了 但注意这并不是说 两个前提共同为同一结论的理由 所以为了理解树型结构的这一层面 即前提1和前提1*都支持 同一个结论 即结论2 最好这样作图 由两个箭头相互独立地从两个前提指向 结论2 如屏幕所示 

这应该能说明为何我们称之为树型结构 因为它是分叉状  看起来像树的枝杈 好吧 它不是真的很像树枝 但是你懂的 我们还是叫它树型结构 接下来我们要从耦合型结构中 分离出树型结构 两者区别就是 树型结构中 前提独立地支撑结论 但在耦合型结构中 它们共同发挥作用 且它们不能独立发挥作用 就像你腿上的关节 连结小腿和大腿 少哪一个都没法正常运动 所以我们称之为耦合型结构 举一个例子 

我生日的时候 妻子总是送我 一件毛衣或者一套桌游 这个礼盒里面不是毛衣 所以这次一定是桌游 注意这里有个论证标记 表明结论是 这次她送我的一定是桌游 这个论证有两个前提 你也许会认为 这是一个线性结构 那么论证就该是这样 妻子总是送我毛衣或者桌游 因此 这个盒子里没装毛衣 因此 这一次她送我的是桌游 可这并不合理啊 我的意思是 “妻子总送我毛衣或桌游” 并不能说明“这个礼盒里面没有毛衣” 来吧我们再试试 也许这是树型结构 就是说论证或许该这样 

前提1 “妻子总是送我毛衣或桌游” 所以“这次她送我的是桌游” 前提1* “这个礼盒里没有毛衣” 所以 “这次她送我的一定是桌游” 两个都不合逻辑 所以这不可能是树型结构 

与之不同的是 这两个前提是共同作用的 “她总是送我 要么毛衣要么桌游” 而第二个前提 “这个礼盒没装毛衣” 这两个前提必须共同作用 只有共同作用才能支持它们的结论 “这次她送我的一定是桌游” 那么如何图示说明耦合型结构呢？ 

我们可以在前提1和前提2之间放一个加号 然后在下面画线来表示 它们共同发挥作用 

从这条线向下引箭头指向结论 如图所示 这就是所谓的耦合型结构 至此 我们已经看过了线型结构 树型结构 和耦合型结构 而且我们可以 组合多种结构 来进行论证 作为范例 我们在前一个例子上稍作变动 前提1 “妻子总是送我毛衣或桌游” 这个礼盒没装毛衣 因为我摇它的时候盒子发出咯咯声 所以这次她送我的一定是桌游 

这个论证 包含了线性结构和耦合型结构 

此处有两个论证标记 一个是结论标记 那么这意味着 最终结论是“她这次送我的一定是桌游” 但是新加的“ 因为” 表明了 我摇盒子时有咯咯声 这说明里面不是毛衣 那么来看阶段一 标准格式论证会是这样的 前提一 我摇盒子时发出咯咯声 那么结论是“这个盒子没装毛衣” 

阶段二是 “这个盒子没装毛衣” 前提1 “妻子总是送我毛衣或桌游” 那么结论是“这次她送我的一定是桌游” 

当然 第一个论证的结论 是第二个论证的前提 于是我们可以把它们串起来 我们可以说 我摇盒子时有咯咯声 所以里面一定没装毛衣 妻子总是送我毛衣或桌游 所以这次她送我的一定是桌游 这样我们的论证就由 线性结构与耦合型结构配合完成了 我们可以像之前一样利用图示 来说明这个论证 从前提一 “我摇盒子时有咯咯声”开始 画一个箭头到结论二 即“盒子没装毛衣” 这是结论二 然后用加号加上前提三 即“妻子总是送我毛衣或桌游” 在二三下面划一道线 引一个箭头下来 指向最终结论四 即“这次她送我的一定是桌游”

### a student example: a debate about smartphone in class

We received a wonderful pair of arguments from a foreign language high school in South Korea. 

One of the groups argued that smartphones should be banned in class, and the others argued that it shouldn't. So we can look at how they conflict with each other, and what we need to do about that. 

So the first argument, which is try to show that smartphones should be banned during class, runs like this. 

Many students are using smartphones during class, and this causes many problems. That kind of sets it up. That's what the problem is. 

But why? Well, they are a lot of addictive apps like, social networking and games that make students check their smartphones continuously. I assume they're talking about checking them continuously during class. And it's probably not really continuously. Like, not all the time. But way too often. I know just what they're talking about, happens in my classes. 

Checking smartphones frequently prevents students from concentrating in class. Now, that tells you what the problem is. There's nothing wrong with smartphones in themselves, if you can do that and still get something out of the class. But if it prevents students from concentrating in class, that's a problem. Cause that's what the class is for. So the students can learn. And notice they don't say other students. It's also the person using the smartphone. They're both distracted. They're both prevented from concentrating in class. That's a problem. 

Next, behaviors that prevent students from concentrating during class, should be banned. We just found out that smartphones do that. Therefore, smartphones should be banned during class. 

Sounds pretty good. Of course, there are questions you could raise. But notice it, the fact that the apps are addictive. That explains why once you've got them on your phone. You can't stop yourself from using them. And you're going to use them even in class, when you know you shouldn't. 

Right? You know you should only use them outside of class, but you end up abusing them inside class cause you're addicted. 

It also says, behaviors that prevent students from concentrating in class should be banned. Eh, you could base questions about that. 

Right? Because things like hey going to the bathroom. 

Going to the bathroom during class might stop other students from concentrating, learning quite as much, but, you gotta go, you gotta go. And so, we have to allow those. So you might want to ask the qualifications about these are activities that distract other students that aren't really necessary and doing this smart phoning during class is probably not really necessary. It doesn't contribute to anybody's educational experience. So, you can fix it up a little bit. But what I want to focus on instead of trying to fix up every little detail like that, is the structure. 

The two main steps, in this argument. First, there are a lot of addictive applications or apps. If there are lots of apps then if smartphones are not banned students will check their Smartphones frequently. So if they're not banned students are going to check them. 

Then if students check their smartphones frequently then students are going to be prevented from concentrating. Therefore, if they're not banned students are going to be prevented from concentrating. 

And if not, banning something results in students being prevented from concentrating, then the schools ought to ban them because after all the point of the school is education, and that's standing in the way. Therefore, smartphones should be banned during class. So now we've got a reconstruction. Where the steps are valid and the only point I want to make for now is 

that it's got a certain kind of structure. Is it a linear structure? Or is it a branching structure? Or is it a joint structure? 

It's a linear structure. Because the conclusion of the first bit. Namely number three, if smart phones are not banned during class then the students will check their smartphones frequently in class becomes a premise in the next step. Which leads to the conclusion five which becomes a premise in the argument for the final conclusion seven. So this is a linear structure. 

Now, let's look at the argument on the other side. The other group of high school students from the same high school in South Korea argued for the opposite conclusion, 

that smartphones should be allowed in class. Of course, if they're allowed, they're not banned. So, they're disagreeing with their schoolmates. 

And here's their argument. Many people say that smartphones should be banned in schools, but they shouldn't. 

Smartphones have apps that help you study, such as dictionaries for foreign languages, and these students are in a foreign language high school so that's important. 

I believe that anything that can help students learn should be allowed in schools. Anything that can help students learn should be allowed in school. Additionally, banning smartphones can result in lack of ways for students to communicate during emergencies. Just imagine there's an emergency and you can't tell the other students that there is an emergency. People might get stuck in the school. They might not know that they need to leave. 

And that could lead to real problems. 

So because smartphones, can help students study. And because they can help them in emergency situations. 

communicate in emergency situations. Smartphones should be allowed, not banned in schools and classrooms. 

Now again, there are lots of questions you could raise. How often do these emergencies happen? Maybe communicating on the smartphone during an emergency is going to make you go more slowly and not able to escape. And so having the smartphone available will actually create more deaths or injuries during an emergency. 

And maybe using this dictionary on your smart phone during class, which seems to be helping you. Is actually stopping you from learning the language yourself. You're now dependent on the smartphone, and it might get in the way of language learning. 

So I think you could raise a lot of questions about this argument, just like the other one, but what I'm interested in here is the structure. 

So let's look at that. 

Notice that word additionally in the middle of their argument. That signals that they're really two arguments here. One is that smartphones can help students learn. And here I'm simplifying quite a bit a bit. Smartphones can help students learn, and then anything that can help students learn should be allowed in school. 

Therefore, smartphones should be allowed in school. That's the first argument. First reason to allow smartphones is that they can aid in education, and that's what schools are all about. 

So they should be allowed. 

Notice the second one, is completely independent. Smartphones can help students communicate during emergencies. Anything that can help students communicate during emergencies should be allowed in school, therefore smart phones should be allowed in schools. They're separate arguments because the second argument would also apply in offices, it should, would apply to students when they're taking exams, where they're not supposed to be getting information from dictionaries or any other information from their smartphone. There still might be an emergency. And so the different arguments apply to different circumstances, but they lead to the same conclusion, that smartphones should be allowed in schools. So what kind of structure do we have here? Do we have a linear structure, or a branching structure, or a joint structure? 

We have a branching structure. Because both sets of premises support the same conclusion. 

Now, I want to ask one more question. 

Does that mean that this argument's better than the first one. Hey, these guys have two arguments. The other group only had one argument. That's gotta be better, right? 

No. It might seem better, because if one argument fails you've got the other one left over. 

But, of course, if one argument is stronger than either of the other two put together, the first group still might have a better reason for their conclusion. 

So you can't just count the number of arguments to figure out who's winning in a disagreement like this. 

And the second point I want to make is that we ought to be looking for compromises. 

When you get a conflict like this between two groups, one wants cell phones banned, one wants smartphones allowed. Well, what the arguments do is they tell us the values at stake, what you really want from the band. Or what you really want by allowing the smartphones. And what that tells you is how to compromise. What we want to find now is some way to pass a regulation. That'll allow students to use smartphones when they're really learning, like when they're using a foreign language dictionary. 

Or, when they really need it like in an emergency. But not so frequently that they're going to interrupt other students, because they're just going on a social network or playing some kind of game that they're addicted to. 

So how're we going to do a regulation like that? Well, maybe we could allow smartphones, but only if they don't have any of those apps on them that students are going to abuse and use too frequently. Or maybe, we're going to be able to monitor their smartphones to see whether they're going on to the right types of program. Dictionaries that help them learn, emergency conversations to help people in trouble. 

And not using them for the ones that are preventing other people from learning by distracting them. Now I don't know whether you can actually have a regulation like that. But one of the nice features of arguments is that they don't just tell you these people want smartphones, these people don't want smartphones banned. Right? 

Instead, it tells you the reasons why. And by learning those reasons we get a picture of what we need in order to formulate a regulation. It'll serve the interests of both groups because they both have a really good point. 


## Completing the Argument

### fill in gaps

It's been a long and winding road, as the Beatles used to say. But we're finally at the last stages of reconstructing arguments. We've looked at stage one which is close analysis, stage two which is get down to basics stage three, which is, sharpen edges. Stage four, is organize parts. And now we're doing stage five, which is, fill in gaps. And we'll also get to stage six, which is, conclude. Stage five really consists of four separate steps. First, we need to assess the argument for validity. Then we need to add suppressed premises. Enough of them to make it valid. Then we need to assess those suppressed premises for truth or falsehood. 

And then we need to qualify the suppressed premises in order to make them true. And the whole goal is to make the suppressed premises both plausible for their truth and enough to make the argument valid. So these steps within the stage really do work in tandem together to try to make the argument good. We already learned how to assess validity. You simply ask is it possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false and if so the argument is not valid and if not the argument is valid. And the way you figure out whether it's possible is, you try to tell a story or describe a situation. And if you can describe a coherent situation where the premises are true and the conclusion is false. Then that shows that the argument's not really valid. The main topic for today is what do you do. When you assess the argument for validity and you find out it's not valid. And the answer is you add suppress premises enough of them to make the argument valid. Now that might seem like cheating. I mean you'd start with an argument that's no good. It's not valid and then you just throw in some extra premises in order to make it valid. 

Why isn't that just distorting the argument, and making up something that wasn't there? The answer, is that it's not really bad. And if it were bad, we'd all be in bad shape, because in every day life, people always take things for granted. They make assumptions. We do it too. And if we didn't, boy, our arguments would be really long and boring. So there's something to be said in favor of suppressing premises, at least the obvious ones that people really do take for granted, 

but we can also get tricked. People can suppress premises that really are questionable and they just don't want us to see that they're making that assumption. It is useful to fill out the argument with suppressed premises to make sure it really is valid, because that brings those assumptions out into the open were we can access whether or not they're true of false. Another reason to fill in suppressed premises is to understand the argument better. Because, if people suppress premises, then they're showing us some of their footprints along the path, but, if we really want to know the full path that their reasoning followed, we've gotta see every single footprint. So, the goal of bringing out the suppressed premises is to let us trace exactly where their reasoning went. From one step to another. So there are two goals. One is to trace the full path every step, and the other goal is to see if there are any missed steps or they're trying to hide something from us by getting rid of one of their footsteps. So, that's the point of bringing out surpressed premises. 

To accomplish these goals is tricky. You have to find suppress premises that are just strong enough to make the argument valid but not so strong that they're going to be implausible. because you don't want to ascribe all kinds of suppressed premises to the person that they didn't really believe and that they didn't really need for their argument. So it's kind of like Goldilocks and the Three Bears. You want suppressed premises to be not too hot, and not too cold, but just right. 

Here's an example from a previous lecture. My wife always gives me either a sweater or a board game. 

This box does not contain a sweater because it rattles. When it's shaken. So this time, she must have given me a board game. And we put this in standard form, this way, first premise, this box rattles when I shake it, and that shows you it doesn't contain a sweater. Third, she always gives me either a sweater or a board game. Conclusion, this time she must have given me a board game. Now the first step of this argument is this box rattles when I shake it and the conclusion there is it doesn't contain a sweater, that's the part of the argument that we want to focus on here and ask whether that argument is valid. No. The argument's not valid, because it's possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion false. How can that happen? Well, my wife might be fooling me. She might know that I expect either a sweater or a board game, so she puts a sweater in the box, and then she puts little rocks around the outside, so when I shake it Well here is something. So thats possible, and that shows the argument is not valid. Well, how can we make the argument valid? The question here is, can we add a suppressed premise that will turn this invalid argument into a valid argument. Here's one that will do the trick. A box that contains a sweater. Doesn't rattle when shaken. The other argument looks like this. This box rattles when I shake it. A box that contains a sweater doesn't rattle when shaken. So this box doesn't contain a sweater. The explicit premise, is that this box rattles when I shake it. The suppress premise is that a box that contains a sweater doesn't rattle when shaken, and together they're supposed to support the conclusion that this box doesn't contain a sweater, but do they really support that conclusion? Is the argument valid? 

Well, it's valid only if there's no possibility that the premises are true and the conclusion is false. Without the suppressed premise, we saw that was possible, because my wife might be fooling me and putting rocks around the sweater. So let's see if that's going to ruin the validity of this argument. No, because, if the sweater's got rocks around it, so it makes noise when I shake it, then, the premise that says a box that contains a sweater doesn't rattle when shaken, turns out to be false. So that's not a case. Where the premises are true and the conclusion's false, because the premise is false in that case. So, by adding this premise, we actually succeeded in making the argument valid. The problem of course, is that validity is not enough for a good argument, as we saw several lectures ago. You can have a valid argument that's very bad when the argument's not sound. What we want really is soundness. So that's why we need the next step. Namely, check the suppressed premises for truth. Assess whether they're true or false, and if they're not true then you need to qualify them in order to make them true, because you don't want to claim that the person giving the argument was assuming this falsehood when they didn't have to. So let's see if there's some way to qualify this surpresssed premise in order to make it true. How can we qualify this premise to make it true? How are we going to do that, let me think, oh, what about that little word only? We can add that. We could say, a box that contains only a sweater doesn't rattle when shaken. 

But the word only what exactly does that mean? We need to clarify that. What exactly does the word only exclude? It excludes something. That's the function of the word only. But what does it exclude? Well. It probably excludes other things that might make the rattling sound. Like, if my wife put rocks in the box. So, we can clarify this premise by saying. A box that contains only a sweater and not anything else that might make a rattling sound when shaken, won't rattle when shaken. 

Well is that premise true? You might quibble about details but it's close enough for now. What we need to do though is to go back and determine whether when we put that suppress premise in, the argument's valid. And the argument now looks like this. This box does rattle when shaken. 

And a box doesn't rattle when shaken if it contains only a sweater and not anything else that makes a rattling sound. 

So this box doesn't contain a sweater. 

Is that valid? 

Well, no, for the same reason we saw before, because my wife might be a trickster who puts rocks around my sweater in the birthday present box, in order to fool me. 

Then, the premises can be true, and the conclusion, false. It's possible that the first premise is true, this box rattles when I shake it. The second premise is true, a box doesn't rattle when shaken if it contains only a sweater and nothing else that makes a rattling sound. 

But it's false. If this box doesn't contain a sweater, because it still does contain a sweater and it contains a sweater in addition to those pesky little rocks that make all that rattling noise. Well if the argument's not valid we got to back to that other step and add another suppressed premise. Remember how I told you that these different steps within this stage work in tandem. 

and what's happening is, you gotta check it for validity, add a suppressed premise, recheck it for validity, maybe add another suppressed premise in. That's what we're doing now. So what kind of suppressed premise could we add? Well, we could add, my wife's not a trickster. But basically that amounts to, she wouldn't put rocks in a birthday present with a sweater in order to fool me. So we can make that a little more explicit by making the suppressed premise something like this. If this box contains a sweater, then it contains only a sweater and it doesn't include anything else that would make a rattling sound when shaken. 

And now, we can stick that as an extra suppressed premise into the argument. Now the argument looks like this. 

This box, rattles when I shake it. A box doesn't rattle when shaken if it contains only a sweater and not anything else that makes a rattling noise when shaken. 

If this box contains a sweater, then it contains only a sweater, and doesn't contain anything else that rattles when shaken. So this box does not contain a sweater. 

Now we have an argument that's valid. And the surpressed premises are true at least given that my wife's not a trickster which she's not I assure you, and it looks like we have a sound reconstruction. Just what we were looking for. Admittedly this argument is a lot longer and more convoluted than the original. And that shows why people suppress premises instead of talk in the way this argument goes. 

And of course many people would be perfectly well convinced by the original argument because, they share the assumptions that are in the suppressed premises. So why do we go to all the trouble to go through this process and add the suppressed premises. Remember, the reason is that we want to understand the pathway between the premises and conclusion, we want to understand how the reasoning works step by step by step. 

And we want to do that because sometimes people are going to include suppressed premises that aren't true and we want to bring them out and make those assumptions explicit so that we can assess them for truth and falsehood. And when you're talking to somebody you trust, you might not have to do that. And it's okay to suppress premises, but when you really want to know whether the argument's any good that's when you want to fill it out with the suppressed premises. The point of going into detail on this example, is to illustrate this stage of reconstruction you want to assess the argument for validity, and suppress premises that make it valid, check them for truth. If they're not true, you qualify them. Then you go back and see whether that qualification made the argument not valid anymore. And then you go back and forth, and back and forth, until you've got a sound reconstruction. 

The same steps are going to apply to all kinds of suppressed premises. And sure enough, there are all kinds of suppressed premises. So let's go through a few examples a lot more quickly in order to show the variety of suppressed premises that are assumed in arguments. Here's one example. Abraham Lincoln turned 40 on February 12th, 1849. Therefore, Charles Darwin also turned 40 on February 12, 1849. Now, is that argument valid? No chance. Of course it's possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion false. 

So we have to add a suppressed premise. The suppressed premise is that Abraham Lincoln and Charles Darwin were born on the same day, and they were it happened to be February 12, 1809. So now we've filled out the argument. Abraham Lincoln turned 40 on February 12, 1849. 

Abraham Lincoln and Charles Darwin were born on the same day. Therefore, Charles Darwin also turned 40 on February 12, 1849. Now is the argument valid? No. It's still not valid. because Darwin might have died before 1849. So we have to add another suppressed premise namely that both Abraham Lincoln and Charles Darwin lived beyond 40. So now we have a fuller argument. 

Abraham Lincoln turned 40 on February 12th 1849. Abraham Lincoln and Charles Darwin were born on the same day. Both of them lived beyond the age of 40. Therefore, Charles Darwin also turned 40 on February 12, 1849. Now the argument looks pretty good. We had to have two suppressed premises, but we finally have a valid argument. And what this shows is that sometimes the suppressed premises are purely factual matters. In this case, that they were born on the same day. And that they both lived beyond 40. So sometimes we have factual suppressed premises. Here's another quick example. You ought to obey her because she's your mother. Here the premise is that she's your mother, and the conclusion's, you ought to obey her. Well, is that argument valid? No way. because it's possible that she's your mother, but it's false that you ought to obey her. When could that happen? Maybe she was like abusive, or stupid, or whatever. 

Then maybe you ought not to obey her, even though she is your mother. 

So, we have to add a premise. Namely, you ought to obey your mother. Now, we can say she's your mother, you ought to obey your mother, therefor you ought to obey her. But of course, that is the suppressed premise you ought to obey your mother is questionable because maybe she was abusive or stupid. So let's add another suppressed premise that your mother was not abusive or stupid. Of course, we also have to qualify that moral premise that you ought to obey your mother if she's not abusive or stupid. And now the argument looks like this. She's your mother. You ought to obey your mother if she's not abusive or stupid. 

Your mother was not abusive or stupid, therefore you ought to obey her. And notice that here, we added a moral premise about the that fact that you ought to obey your mother under certain conditions namely she's not abusive or stupid. And the second premise is she was not abusive or stupid so we have a moral premise and a factual premise. Both being suppressed in the argument that you ought to obey her, because she's your mother. Here's another. It's the Sabbath. So you ought go to the Synagogue. Well, that's clearly not valid. Once suppressed premises you're Jewish. The other suppressed premise is you haven't been to Synagogue already today on this Sabbath. And the third suppressed premise is a religious norm namely Jews ought to go to the Synagogue on the Sabbath and you need that whole bunch of suppressed premises in order to get. From the premise that is the Sabbath to the conclusion that you ought to go to Synagogue. Now of course all of those premises might be questionable, some people would question them, some people would deny them, but the point here is to figure out what's being assumed by somebody who gave the original argument. And anybody who says it's the Sabbath so you ought to go to Synagogue, seems to be assuming that you're Jewish, you haven't been already, and Jews ought to go to the Synagogue on the Sabbath. 

So what these suppressed premises do is they bring out the assumptions that somebody who gave that argument must have had in mind. The last case is a little bit trickier. It has to do with linguistics suppressed premises. Janet and Bob are first cousins, therefore they share a grandparent. Now, in order to understand that argument, we have to know that first cousins always share a grandparent. That just follows from the definition of what a first cousin is. 

But, it's not quite so obvious is that all biological sisters are female, and so there's even more need to bring out that linguistic suppressed premise in this case. But it's still not necessary to make the argument valid. It's just not possible that Janet and Bob. Are first cousins, and they don't share, a grand parent. Because the suppressed premise is purely linguistic, so it's necessarily true. So, you can't possibly, be first cousins without sharing a grandparent. Still, the point of bringing out linguistic suppressed premises is to show every little step along the way the argument might be valid without those suppressed linguistic premises but we won't understand why it's valid and why the reasoning goes through unless we add the linguistic suppressed premise. So it's worth doing that. Sh, here's a trick. Don't tell anybody. Okay? It's just between me and you. You could always make any argument valid just by adding a suppressed premise that says, if the premises are true then the conclusion is true. But don't tell anybody because. If people start doing that, and they make the argument valid that way, with that suppressed premise, we're never going to understand the pathway of reasoning. It makes the argument valid, but it doesn't serve the real purpose of the unending suppressed premises, which is to understand the pathway of reasoning. So you can do that, it's a trick. It makes the argument valid, but it doesn't achieve our goal because our goal is not just to make the argument valid, it's to make the argument valid so that we can understand the pathway of reasoning. 

So, it's important to know that trick, but don't use it. Unless you have to. The examples so far have been pretty trivial, I admit it. But the same points apply in very important context, such as political debates. Politicians can suppress premises in perfectly legitimate ways they're just trying to save time and make their arguments more efficient, maybe even sometimes clearer because you don't have to add all of those little details. 

But sometimes politicians abuse suppressed premises. They take things for granted that they shouldn't be taking for granted. 

And here's an example. A politician might argue, my opponent is soft on crime because he's opposed to the death penalty, well, that assumes as a suppressed premise that anyone who's opposed to the death penalty must be soft on crime. And if the politician were to come 

out and say that it would seem pretty questionable. And that's probably why he suppresses it. 

And then another politician might say, but my opponent is in favor of the death penalty so he must not have read all the recent studies that show that the death penalty doesn't deter. 

Well that argument assumes a suppressed premise that if you read those studies you would be convinced by them and that the only point of the death penalty is deterrence. But the point is that politicians talking about extremely important issues can take things for granted, that if they were brought into the light of day would be very questionable, and that is why they hide them. So when you're listening to people give arguments on important issues in your life, then you ought to be looking for these suppressed premises and asking yourself whether or not you really ought to be agreeing with them about that assumption. Finally, we've finished reconstruction. Yippee, right? Oh, no, not quite. because there's one more stage. And that stage is drawing a conclusion. Of course, if we've come up with a sound reconstruction then we know that the argument is sound, and we know that the conclusion is true, because every sound argument has a true conclusion. But if we don't come up with a sound reconstruction, then what do we say? Well we kind of ask whose fault is it. It might be the fault of the argument maybe we couldn't come up with a sound reconstruction because there just is no sound reconstruction. But maybe we didn't come up with a sound reconstruction because we just weren't imaginative enough or didn't try hard enough. 

Still if we try really long and hard. And charitably interpret the argument as best we can to make it look as good as we can and we still can't make it sound, then we've at least got reason to believe that the argument's not sound. Of course, that doesn't mean that the conclusion's not true because unsound arguments can still have true conclusions. 

But at least we know that this argument doesn't prove that the conclusion's true. And so this method of reconstruction can lead us either to the belief that the argument is sound because we found a sound reconstruction or to the conclusion that the argument's not sound. Because we tried long and hard to find a sound reconstruction and didn't. But that's still not going to show us that the conclusion of the argument is false. The point of reconstruction then is to reach a conclusion on this issue of whether the argument is sound or not. And if we try our best, and do it as well as we can, and charitably, then we can be justified in believing that the argument's sound or not. 

就像披头士所唱的 这真是一条漫长而曲折的道路 不过我们终于到了重塑论证的最后一个阶段 我们已经讲完了第一阶段 严密分析 第二阶段 回归基础 第三阶段 磨砺棱角 第四阶段 组织要素 现在我们来到第五阶段 填补间隙 接着还会讲到第六阶段 总结 第五阶段其实分为四个步骤 首先 我们要评估论证的有效性 然后 为了使论证成立 我们要补充隐含前提 接下来我们要检验那些隐含前提的真假 

最后修正这些隐含前提 以保证它们的正确 总的来说 我们是为了让隐含前提既要合情合理 又足以能支撑论证的有效 所以在这一阶段中 这些步骤对一个成功的论证而言都是必要的 我们已经学过了如何评估有效性 你只需要想想 有没有可能前提是真而结论是假 是这样的话 那么论证不成立 否则它就是有效的 而要考虑是否可能成立的方式 就是去试着设想一个故事 或者描述一种情境 如果你能想到一种自洽的情况 这个论证才是成立的 那就说明这个论证并不是真的有效 今天的主题是 当你检验完 论点的有效性 发现它是错的时候 该怎么办 答案是 添加足够多的隐含前提 使论证变得有效 尽管这看起来像是在骗人 比如你的论证一开始就有问题 所以你就附加一堆前提 来使其成立 

这么做不就是歪曲论点 胡编一气了吗？ 其实其实 这么做也不是完全不对 如果一定要说它不对 那我们可就糟糕了 因为日常生活中 人们总是想当然 人们做各种假设 我们也会这么做 如果不这样做 天啊 我们的论证就会又臭又长 这时候隐含前提就帮了我们的大忙 至少那些人们认为理所当然的隐含前提是如此 

但我们也有被蒙骗的时候 人们会故意隐藏一些有问题的前提 不想让我们知道他的话里其实暗含这种假设 所以在论证时添上隐含前提 能帮助我们验证它的有效性 因为这样就可以揭露那些假设 让我们得以检验它们的真假 补充隐含前提的另一个原因 是为了更好地理解论证 因为当人们省略了一些前提时 也同时表示出了他们思考时的一些步骤 但如果我们想知道推理的完整轨迹 就需要考察推理过程的每一步 揭示隐藏前提的目的在于 让我们精确地跟踪推理过程 一步接着一步 这就是我们的两个目的 其一是追踪推理的每个步骤 其二是检查是否遗漏了某些步骤 或者发现对方故意掩饰的推理步骤 这就是提出隐含前提的目的 

要完成这两个目标需要一些技巧 我们补充的隐含前提 要能强到能支撑论点 又不会过强得似非而是 因为你总不能提出各种各样的隐含前提 来向压根不相信的人去解释 他们根本不需要这样多的解释 这就像是三只小熊的故事 提出的隐含前提既不能过火 也不能无关痛痒 要恰到好处 

举一个之前提到过的例子 我的妻子送我的生日礼物 要么是一件毛衣 要么是一盒桌游 

生日礼盒里没有毛衣 因为摇晃它的时候 它会咔咔作响 所以 她这次的礼物一定是桌游 我们把这个论证写成标准形式 前提一 盒子晃起来会响 因此 二 表明里面没有毛衣 三 她送我的要么是毛衣要么是桌游 结论 这次她送我的一定是桌游 第一步 盒子晃起来会响 结论是盒子里没有毛衣 这是我们要关注的重点 我们要问 这个论证成立吗 当然不 论证不成立 因为存在前提正确 但结论错误的可能性 怎么会这样 呃 我妻子可能在作弄我 她想到了我会猜不是毛衣就是桌游 所以她就在盒子里装了毛衣 又放进一些小石子 当我晃盒子时就会听到响动 这是有可能的 这样就证明了论证并不成立 那么 我们怎么让论证有效呢？ 问题在于 我们能否补充前提 来把一个无效论证变得有效 有一个办法是这样的 装有毛衣的盒子晃起来是不会响的 另一点是 这个盒子晃起来有响声 但装有毛衣的盒子是不会响的 所以 这个盒子里没有毛衣 明确的前提是 这个盒子有响声 隐含前提是 装有毛衣的盒子 晃起来不会响 把这两点放在一起 应该要能够说明结论是盒子里没有毛衣 但它们真的支持这个结论吗？ 这个论证有效吗？ 

只有当 前提为真结论为假 的可能性被排除以后 这个论证才是成立的 如果没有隐含前提 这种可能性就不能被排除 因为我妻子的确可能用石子耍我 我们来看看 这到底会不会破坏论证的有效性 不会 因为如果毛衣旁确实有石子 那它晃起来就确实会响 那么隐含前提 装有毛衣的盒子 晃起来不会响 就是假的了 所以不存在这种情况 前提为真结论为假 因为这会导致前提也为假 所以 加上隐含前提后 我们的确让论证成立了 当然这里还有个问题 就是我们以前讲过的 成功的论证不能只考虑有效性 当论证不充分时就很难说它是一个成功的论证 我们追求的是充分 完备 所以我们需要做下一步 也就是 验证隐含前提是否为真 检验它们的真假 如果它们非真 那就要调整它们使之为真 因为没人希望当他在论证时 发现不得不承认一些前提原本就是错的 那么我们来看看有没有办法 把这个隐含前提变成真的 我们要怎样使它成真呢？ 到底要怎么做 让我们试试用 只 这个词来限定 加入这个词 我们可以说 只装了毛衣的盒子晃起来不会响 

只 这个词到底意味着什么？ 我们要说清楚 只 这个词到底排除了什么？ 它将一些可能性排除在外 这就是它的功能 它究竟排除了什么？ 或许它将一些其他会发出声响的可能性排除了 比如放在盒子里的石子 因此可以这样来明确前提 一个只装了毛衣且没有其他任何会发出声响东西的盒子 摇晃它的时候会发出声响 

这次前提为真了吗？ 仍能继续吹毛求疵 但至此 它已经足够完善了 现在我们要做的是返回去 在论证中加入这个隐含前提 看看它是否成立 论证现在是这样的 这个盒子晃起来是会响的 

而一个只装了毛衣 且没有装其他会发出声响东西的盒子 是不会响的 

所以 这个盒子里没有毛衣 

这次对了吧？ 

不 还是不对 因为同样的原因 我妻子还是可能使坏 她在装有毛衣的生日礼盒里放进石子来作弄我 

这样的话 前提固然为真 但 结论为假 有可能 第一个前提是真的 这个盒子晃起来的确会响 第二个前提也是真的 一个只有毛衣且没有任何其他会响东西的盒子 摇晃它不会发出声响 

你又错了 如果你的结论是盒子里没装毛衣 因为它就是有一件毛衣 同时也还有石子 当摇晃盒子的时候还是会有声响 如果论证不成立 我们又要退回去 来加入更多的隐含前提 记得我说过的吗 本阶段中 每一个步骤都是必要的 

要一步步检查 验证它们的有效性 加入隐含前提 再次验证 或许还需要加入隐含前提 也就是我们现在正在做的 那么 我们可以加入什么隐含前提呢？ 比如 我妻子不会从中作梗 但这就等于是说 她不会在生日礼盒里放小石头来愚弄我 因此我们可以再明确一点 作类似这样的隐含前提 如果说这个盒子装了毛衣 那就表明它就只有毛衣 没有其它会发出声响的东西 

现在 我们把这一条加入论证作为一个隐含前提 现在这个论证成了这个样子 

这个盒子晃起来会响 一个只装了毛衣的盒子 没装其它能发出声响的东西 晃起来不会响 

如果这个盒子装了毛衣 它就只有毛衣 没有其它会发出声响的东西 因此 这个盒子里没有毛衣 

终于 我们得到一个有效的论证了 隐含前提都是真 至少说明我妻子不是个捣蛋鬼 当然我可以保证她不是 看起来我们的论证重塑终于完备了 这就是我们想要的 确实 现在这个论证比最初的版本长得多 绕得多 于是你就能明白为什么人们要把一些前提隐含起来 而不是像刚才论证的那样 

当然 就最初的论证而言 人们也能完全地相信它 因为人们总能做出相同的隐含前提 那我们又为什么要如此大费周章 通过这个方式将这些隐含前提再提出来呢？ 记住 原因在于 我们希望能理解从前提到结论之间的思路 希望能理解每一步的论证过程 

并且我们希望 当人们论述中含有并不真实的隐含前提时 我们能够把它找出来 明确理清这些假设 以便于我们判断它们的真假 不过与你信任的人交谈时 你就无需这样 省略前提并没有错 但如果你想要完善一个论证 这就是你需要做的 补充隐含前提来使它充分 之所以在这个例子上大费笔墨 是为了具体说明在重塑论证过程中 你需要判断论证的成立与否 隐含能够让其成立的前提 并验证它们的真假 以及调整错误的前提 之后再回过头来 看看你的调整是否会让论证不再成立 反复验证 反复验证 直到论证重塑变得充分 

这些步骤应该应用在所有类型的隐含前提上 毫无疑问 隐含前提的形式是多种多样的 接下来让我们快速地看几个例子 用这些例子来展现论证中隐含前提的多样性 下面是第一个例子 亚伯拉罕·林肯在1849年2月12日就40岁了 因此 查尔斯·达尔文 在1849年2月12日也是40岁 这个论证成立的吗 当然不 当然可能有前提正确 但结论是错误的情况 

因此必须加入一个隐含前提 就是 亚伯拉罕·林肯和 查尔斯·达尔文是同一天出生的 而他们出生那天恰好是1809年的2月12日 现在我们就将这个论述补充完整了 亚拉伯罕·林肯在1849年2月12日这天40岁了 

亚拉伯罕·林肯和查尔斯·达尔文同一天出生 因此 查尔斯·达尔文在1849年2月12日这一天也40岁了 现在 这个论证成立吗 还是没有 它现在依然是不成立的 因为有可能达尔文还没到1849年就去世了 所以我们必须再加一个隐含前提 亚拉伯罕·林肯 和查尔斯·达尔文在世都超过了40年 现在我们有了一个更完整的论证 

亚拉伯罕·林肯在1849年2月12日这天40岁了 亚拉伯罕·林肯和 查尔斯·达尔文在同一天出生 而且他们都活过了40岁 因此 查尔斯·达尔文在1849年2月12日这一天也40岁了 现在这个论证就好多了 我们有必要加上了两个隐含前提 最终得到了一个正确的论证 从这个例子可以看出 有些时候 隐含前提只包含有事实 就好像在这个例子中 他们出生在同一天 而且他们都活过了40岁 所以 有些情况下隐含前提是事实性的 下面再来看一个简单的例子 因为她是你母亲 所以你必须听她的话  这里的前提是 她是你的母亲 结论 你必须听她的话 那么 这个论证成立吗 当然不 因为可能她的确是你的母亲 但是你必须听她的话这点是错误的 比如什么情况呢 比如说她蛮横 愚蠢 或者其它什么 

那你就不应该听从她的话 即使她是你的母亲 

因此我们需要加设一个前提 亦即 你应该服从你妈妈 我们可以说 她是你的母亲 你应该听你妈的话 因此 你要听她的话 不过 你应该听你母亲的话这个前提是存疑的 因为她可能蛮横或愚蠢 所以再加入一个隐含前提 你的母亲既不蛮横也不愚蠢 另外 我们还需要加入一个道德判断的前提 即如果你母亲不蛮横愚蠢 你就应该听她的话 现在论证是这样的 她是你的母亲 如果你母亲不蛮横愚蠢 你就应该听她的话 

你的母亲既不蛮横又不愚蠢 因此 你应该听她的话 注意 我们加入了一个道德判断前提 在一定的条件下 你就应该听你母亲的话 亦即 她并不蛮横或愚蠢 第二个前提则是她既不蛮横也不愚蠢 这两个道德性和事实性的前提 都在这个论证中被隐含起来了 因为她是你母亲 所以你应该听她的话 下面再看一个例子 今天是安息日 所以你应该去犹太教堂 这显然不成立 它隐含了你是犹太人的前提 另一个隐含前提则是 你在这个安息日还没有去过教堂 这第三项隐含前提 是一项宗教规范 即犹太人应该在安息日里去犹太教堂 你需要有这一系列的隐含前提来帮助你得到结论 从今天是安息日的前提 到你应该去教堂的结论 当然所有的这些前提可能都是存疑的 有人会质疑它们 也有人会否定它们 但是这里的关键在于 分辨出在原论证语境下所作出的假定 当有人说这是安息日 所以你应该去犹太教堂 这就假定了你是犹太人 今天你还没去教堂 并且犹太人应该在安息日去教堂 

这些隐含前提的作用在于 它们表达出了论证者在自己心中已有的假定 它们表达出了论证者在自己心中已有的假定 最后一个例子相比于之前有些复杂 它与语义上的隐含前提有关 珍妮特和鲍勃是堂兄妹 因此他们有相同的祖父母 为了理解这一论证 我们需要知道堂兄妹的祖父母是相同的 这一点 是从堂兄妹的定义直接得出的 

但生物学上的姐妹都是女性这一点并不显而易见 所以 这里更需要把语义上的隐含前提指出来 不过指出这一点对确保论证成立并非必需 因为 如果珍妮和鲍勃是堂兄妹 他们的祖父母就不可能不相同 因为这个隐含前提纯粹是字义上的 所以它必然为真 不可能在祖父母不同的情况下还是堂兄妹 指出语义上隐含前提的意义在于 表现出论证过程中的每一小步 没有语义上的隐含前提论证也可以是成立的 只是如果不指出它来 在理解论证的过程中就可能遇到困难 这就是语义性隐含前提的意义所在 下面教你一个小花招 千万别告诉别人 你知我知 好吗 只要加上这样一个隐含前提你就可以让任何论证有效 即 如果前提为真 那么结论为真 不过不要告诉任何人  因为如果人们用这种方式来使论证有效 那我们就再也搞不懂推理过程了 这虽然能使论述成立 但它并不能达到我们的真正目的 不能让我们通过环环相扣的隐含前提来理解推理过程 你可以这么做 但它终究是个小伎俩 它让论证有效 但无助于我们的目标 在让论证成立之外 我们更是要通过论证来理解思维过程 

对它了解很有必要 但别使用它 除非万不得已 到现在为止所举的例子都很琐碎 这个我也承认 不过同样的道理也能适用于 非常重要的情景下 比如政治辩论 政治家们能巧妙而合理地把前提隐含起来 为了节省时间 使自己的表述更有效率 有时还可以使表达更清晰 因为他们省掉了细枝末节 

但有的时候 政治家们会滥用隐含前提 将并不自然的事情变得理所当然 

这有个例子下面举一个例子 一位政治家争辩道 他的对手在犯罪问题上过于软弱 因为他反对死刑 这里的隐含前提是 任何反对死刑的人在犯罪问题上都过于软弱 但如果这位政治家 把这一前提点出来 

他的论证就很可能站不住脚了 这也就是为什么这个前提被隐含起来了 

另一位政治家说  我的对手支持死刑 所以他一定没有把最近关于死刑的研究结果都读一遍 这些研究显示死刑无助于震慑犯罪 

这里的隐含前提是 如果你读过这些研究结果就一定认同它们 以及死刑只是用于震慑犯罪 重点在于 政治家们在谈论一些 非常重要的事情的时候 常将一些前提认作理所当然 但如果他们将这些前提明确地提出来 它们就非常容易被质疑了 这就是为什么它们都被隐去 所以 当你在参考他人对你生活的重大事件表达意见时 你就应该去留意隐含前提 问问自己是否应该同意这些假定 问问自己是否应该同意这些假定 好了 我们终于讲完了重塑论证 太棒了 对不对 不 先别高兴的太早 因为我们还有一步需要做 最后这步就是 得出结论 当然 如果我们的重塑足够坚实充分 那我们的论证也是充分完备的 我们就可以相信结论为真 因为每一个完备论证的结论都是真的 但是 如果我们没有得到完备的重塑 又该怎么做呢 我们应该问一问错误出在哪 有可能论证本身就是错的 没有得出充分重塑的原因在于原本就不会有一个完备的重塑 更或许只是因为我们想象力不足 或者没有尽力 更或许只是因为我们想象力不足 或者没有尽力 

当我们付出了长久的努力 尽我们所能去解读一个论证 尽力去完善论证重塑 但仍旧无法得出充分的论证 此时 我们至少有理由相信论证本身的不完备 当然 这不意味着结论就是不对的 因为不完备的论证也可能得出真的结论 

只是结论的真假无法被这个论证所证实 通过重塑的方法我们可以得出 要么论证是充分的 因为我们得到了完备的重塑 要么对于结论而言 这个论证尚不充分 因为我们苦苦尝试 但还是无法得到一个完备的重塑 但即使这样 也不能证明这个论证的结论是假的 重塑的关键点在于 通过论证是否充分这一方式 来验证能否得出原有结论 当我们尽己能之后 就可以无愧于心地去相信自己得出的结果了 

### conclude

Finally, we've finished reconstruction. Yipee! Right? Oh no, not quite. Because there's one more stage and that stage is drawing the conclusion. Of course, if we've come up with a sound reconstruction, then we know that the argument's sound and we know, that the conclusion is true, because every sound argument has a true conclusion. But, if we don't come up with a sound reconstruction, then what do we say? 

Well, we gotta ask, who's fault is it. It might be the fault of the argument. Maybe we couldn't come up with a sound reconstruction 'cuz there just is no sound reconstruction. But maybe we didn't come up with a sound reconstruction because we just weren't imaginative enough. Or didn't try hard enough. 

Still, if we try really long and hard. And charitably interpret the argument as best we can to make it look as good as we can, and we still can't make it sound. Then, we've at least got reason to believe that the argument's not sound. Of course, that doesn't mean that the conclusion's not true. Because unsound arguments can still have true conclusions. 

But at least we know that this argument doesn't prove that the conclusion's true. And so this method of reconstruction can lead us either to the belief that the argument is sound because we found the sound reconstruction. Or to the conclusion that the argument's not sound because we tried long and hard to find a sound reconstruction and didn't, but that's still not going to show us that's the conclusion of the argument. Is false. 

The point of reconstruction then, is to reach a conclusion on this issue of whether the argument is sound or not. And if we try our best and do it as well as we can and charitably, then we can be justified in believing that the argument is sound or not. 

我们终于完成了论证的重建 欢呼！ 对吧? 不 我们还差一步 因为我们还没有得出结论 当然 如果我们已经完成了一个可靠的重建  那么我们知道论证可靠 我们就会知道其结论为真 因为每一个可靠的论证 其结论都为真 但是 如果我们没有实现可靠的重建 我们会怎么做？ 

我们会问 错在哪里？ 可能是论证出了错 也许我们无法完成一个可靠的重建  因为重建本身就不可靠 但或许我们没能重建可靠的论证的原因 只是因为我们的想象力不足 或者是尝试得还不够 

但是 如果我们努力尝试了很久 诠释这个论证 使它看起来尽可能的好  但终究没能让它变得可靠 那么 我们至少有理由相信这个论证不可靠 当然 这不意味着结论为假 因为不可靠的论证也会有结论为真的情况 

但是至少我们知道 此论证无法证明结论为真 因此 这种重建的方法 要么让我们相信该论证是可靠的 因为我们找到了可靠的重建方式 要么让我们得出该论证不可靠的结论 因为我们苦苦尝试但还是得不到可靠的重建  但这并不是说 论证的结论 为假 

重建的关键在于 无论论证可靠与否 都要得到这个论题的结论 如果我们已经竭尽所能 我们就有理由相信一个论证的可靠与否 【果壳教育无边界字幕组】校对：Reckless-bell 审核：阿澈 


## Reconstruction

### an example of reconstruction (part 1)

Now, we've really done it. We're finished with reconstruction. Hooray! But we want to go through it one more time in a detailed example to show how the, all the different stages fit together. And which example are we going to pick? Well, if you've been in the course this far, I bet you can guess. Robert Redford again. We're going to look at paragraph three of his article, and go through reconstruction to show that reconstruction gives you an even deeper understanding than when we first went through it using close analysis alone. Reconstruction begins with close analysis. So, the first thing I'll do is read through the passage and mark the important words in order to do a close analysis of Redford's paragraph. The BLM says its hands are tied. Remember, the BLM is the Bureau of Land Management. Why? 

Because, because, is a premise marker. 

It's indicating that the sentence after it is a premise for the conclusion that the BLM's hands are tied. 

Because these lands were set aside subject to valid existing rights. You could say that valid and rights are evaluative terms, but that's not going to matter to our analysis here. 

And Conoco has a lease that gives it a right to drill. 

And notice, we've got a tricky argument marker here. Gives it, because the point of that sentence is that it's the lease that explains why it has the right to drill, or justifies the claim that it does have the right to drill. So, gives it is an argument marker. And in particular, it has the right to drill is the conclusion, so it's a conclusion marker. 

Sure, Conoco has a lease. Sure is going to be an assuring term. 

More than one, in fact. In fact, is another assuring term. But, 

but is going to be a discounting term, indicating that there's an objection being responded to. 

Those leases were originally issued without sufficient environmental study or public input. Now, you could think that originally is a guarding term. Because it's not saying that there never was sufficient environmental input, that is environmental study or public input. It might of come later just not originally, but again, that's not going to play any part in the argument itself. So, it could be a guarding term, but you can mark it if you want. But as a result, the first three words of the next sentence that's clearly an argument marker. And it's indicating that the sentence after it is a conclusion. So, it's a conclusion marker. 

None of them conveyed a valid right to drill. What's more, now, we're indicating that there's a separate argument, there's a new premise coming, another reason for the same conclusion, in deciding to issue a permit to drill right now. 

The BLM did not conduct a full analysis of the environmental impacts of drilling in these incomparable lands, but, discounting. Right? Instead determined that there would be no significant environmental harm on the basis of. This is telling you how they reached that determination, was an abbreviated review. They had an abbreviated review that justified or explained their determination. So, that's a premise marker. That didn't even look. Even is a tricky one. It's discounting an objection. It's saying, well, they looked a little bit, but they didn't look at this. 

Discounting the objection that they did look at least some. They didn't even look at drilling on the other federal leases. Okay? Sounds like, clearly a guarding term. It's not saying it is, but it sounds like Washington doublespeak. Doublespeak is bad, you don't want to doublespeak to me, and maybe to me is another guarding term. In the sense that it sounds that way to me but not to others. So we could mark that as a guard as well. 

So, we have finished stage one of reconstructing this argument. We've done a close analysis. 

The next stage is to get rid of all the excess verbiage. So we'll start a new screen and do that. 

The BLM says its hand are tied. Well, the claim is that its hands are tied. So we can get rid of the fact that the BLM says that. Why, because, we can get rid of those words, because they're going to get replaced by a dot pyramid in standard form. 

These lands were set aside subject to valid existing rights, good. And Conoco has a lease that gives it the right to drill, good. And we can get rid of, because we're going to have two separate premises there. That gives it, right. Well, that's going to be an argument marker as we saw. That's going to get replaced by another dot pyramid. Sure, Conoco has a lease, more than one in fact. Now notice there Redford is admitting what his opponent claims. But that's not going to be part of his argument. He's just saying, I recognize that. His argument is going to be based on different claims. So we can get rid of, sure, Conoco has a lease, more than one in fact. And the but, tells you that he's just answering an objection. 

These leases were originally issued without sufficient environmental study or input. That's going to be an important premise. As a result, we saw that was an argument marker. going to be replaced by a dot pyramid like the others. None of them conveyed a valid right to drill. What's more, another argument marker So, it's going to get replaced by a dot pyramid. In deciding that, to issue a permit to drill now, the BLM did not conduct a full analysis blah blah blah, but instead. That's going to be discounting terms. And that's going to be important for understanding what the sentences are doing, but it's not going to get repeated in the premise when we put it in standard form. 

They determined there'd be no significant impact on the basis of an abbreviated review that didn't even look at drilling on the other federal leases. The next step is to take all the parts that weren't crossed out, their going to be the explicit premises and conclusion in the argument, and put them into standard form. And if you think about this paragraph, there really two arguments. Because at the start, what Redford tries to do is to state what the BLM's argument was to begin with. And then he gives his own argument against what the BLM says. So, BLM's argument can be put in standard form like this. 

First premise, Conoco has a lease that gives it the right to drill. Second premise, these lands were set aside subject to valid existing rights. And those two premises lead to the conclusion that the BLM's hands were tied. 

Now, that's the BLM's arguement that Redford is arguing against. Redford's own argument on the other side starts with the premise, those leases were originally issued without sufficient environmental study or public input. 

Second premise, in deciding to issue a permit to drill now, the BLM did not conduct a full analysis of the environmental impacts of drilling on these incomparable lands. But instead determined there would be no significant environmental harm on the basis of an abbreviated review, that didn't even look at drilling on the other federal leases. 

Those two premises lead to the conclusion that none of these conveyed a valid right to drill. 

And, then there's another premise, these lands were set aside subject to valid existing rights. 

And that's supposed to lead the conclusion, this is Washington doublespeak. Well, we'll have to see what all that means when we clarify. But that's basically the standard form. It might be a good idea to double check, because you want to make sure that every sentence you didn't cross out, is somewhere there in the standard form. So, let's look back at the passage where we crossed out the excess and make sure everything is there in the standard form. 

Okay. It's all there. 

终于 我们学完了论证的重建 哦耶！ 但是我还想再重新梳理一遍 用一个详细的例子 展示怎样结合使用不同的论证方法 我们要用哪个例子呢? 嗯 如果你一直在跟这门课 我敢打赌你会猜 又是罗伯特·雷德福 (Robert Redford) 我们要看的是他文章的第三段 通过重建的方法来加深你的理解 而不是像我们第一次讲重建时那样 仅仅只是详细分析 详细分析是重建的开始 所以 我要做的第一件事就是 通读全文 并标记重要词语 以对雷德福的文章进行详细分析 “BLM说他们对此束手无策” 记住 这里的BLM是 土地管理局 “为什么呢？” 

“因为——” 这里的“因为”是一个前提标记 

它标志着 它之后的句子 会是“BLM束手无策”这个结论的前提 

他们有正当权利对这片土地另作安排 正当权利是可以评估的术语 但是这和我们的分析没关系 

康诺克石油公司有权利在租用期间进行开采 

注意 这里有一个论证技巧的标志 因为这句话的重点在于 “租约”解释了在租用期间 它有权利在这里开采 或拥有开采的正当理由 所以 这里也做了一个论证标记 更确切地说  是论证的结论 因此它是个结论标志 

的确 康诺克石油公司有租约 “的确”在这里是保证术语 

“事实上不止一个” “事实上” 是另外一个保证术语 但是 

“但是”是一个削弱词 标志着提出异议 

"当初签订这些租约的时候 并没有 “（先进行）充分的环境调查或公共投入” 现在 你可以认为 “当初”是一个让步词 因为它不是说从来都没有 进行过充分的环境投入 也就是环境调查 或公共投入 而是说调查并非一开始就进行了 但这并不会对这里的论证造成任何影响 所以 这可以是一个让步词 如果你想 也可以把它标出来 因此 下一句话的  前三个词语 很明显示论证标志 也表明这后面的句子是结论  所以 这是个结论标志 

这些结论没有说明开采是合法权利 “此外——” 现在 我们遇到了另外一个论证 它拥有一个新的前提 并为之前的结论提供了 另一个原因 “现在 在决定签发开采许可证时 

“BLM并没有全面地去分析研究 开采会对这块绝佳的土地 造成怎样的环境影响” “但是” 代表削弱 对吧？ “相反的 他们确定这并不会 “造成非常显著的环境破坏 通过...” 这是告诉我们他们是怎么达到这个“确定”的 “仅仅是简略的审查” 他们进行了简略的审查 这解释了 他们的决定 所以 这是一个前提标记 “他们甚至没有考虑…” “甚至”是一个复杂的词 它削弱相反的内容 它说明的是 他们考虑了一点点 但是他们并没有考虑到这个 

削弱了“他们确实看了一点” 这一相反的内容 “他们甚至没有参考 其他联邦租约中的开采条例" 懂了吗？ "听起来就像是" 毫无疑问 让步词 这并不是说它就是 但是“它听起来像是华盛顿官腔” 官腔是不好的 当然你也不会想要拐弯抹角地说话 “在我看来” “在我看来”应该是另一个让步词 在这方面 它对于我来说是这样的 但对别人来说不一定一样 所以我们也可以把它标记为让步 

所以我们结束了 重建这一论证的第一步骤 我们完成了详细分析 

下一步骤是除去所有多余的词语 让我们换一页来完成这一步骤 

“BLM说他们对此束手无策” 这里的声明是 他们对此束手无策 所以我们可以省去“BLM说”这一事实 “为什么呢？因为…” 我们可以除去这些词 因为 它们将会被替换成标准格式中的 因为、所以符号（点金字塔） 

“根据有效的 “现存权利 这些土地应当被留出” 没错 “康菲公司也有一纸租约 使它拥有开采的权利” 没错 我们可以除去"也" 因为这里有两个独立的前提 “——使它拥有” 好了 就像我们看到的一样 这是一个论证标记 它也可以用因为所以符号来替换 “康菲公司确实有租约 事实上不止一个” 现在注意这里雷德福是在承认 对方的声明 但是这不会成为他论证的一部分 他只是说 我意识到这一点了 他的论证是基于不同的事实的 所以我们可以除去 “康菲公司确实有租约 事实上不止一个” 这里的“但是” 告诉我们 作者在提出异议 

“当初签订这些租约的时候 并没有 （先进行）充分的环境调查或投入” 这将会是一个重要的前提 “正因此” 这是一个论证标记 同样能被替换成因为所以符号  这些结论没有说明开采是合法权利 “此外”是另外一个论证标记 所以 它同样可以替换成因为所以符号 “现在 在决定签发开采许可证时 “BLM并没有全面地去分析研究 什么什么什么的” “但是相反的” 这是一个削弱词 它对理解这个句子 非常重要 但是 当我们把它换成标准格式时 它就不会再在前提里重复了 

“仅仅在简略的审查之后 甚至没有参考其他联邦租约中的开采条例 就确定了这不会造成显著的环境破坏” 接下来的步骤是 把所有 我们没有划掉的部分进行标准化 也就是论证中那些明确的前提和结论 再仔细想一想这个段落 其实它有两个论证 因为雷德福一开始想要做的就是 阐明BLM的论证 接下来他反驳BLM的话语 给出了自己的论证 目前为止 我的想法是所以 BLM的论证可以被标准化 就像这样 

第一个前提 康菲有一个租约 使它拥有开采权 第二个前提 这些土地由于有效的 开采权而被闲置 这两个前提推出了 BLM对此束手无策的结论 

这就是雷德福所反对的 BLM的论证 另外一边是雷德福自己的论证 由一个前提开始 当初签发这些租约的时候 并没有经过充分的环境调查或公共投入 

第二个前提 现在决定再签发开采的 同意书时 BLM并没有 去全面地分析、研究 开采会对这块极佳的地皮 产生怎样的环境影响 但是相反的 仅在简略的调查之后 甚至都没有考虑其他联邦租约中的开采 他们就确定了 这不会造成显著的环境破坏 

这两个前提推出了 “这些租约都不能赋予其有效的开采权利” 这个结论 

接下来又是另外一个前提 这些土地受制于 有效的现存权利

### an example of reconstruction (part 2)

The next stage is to sharpen edges. And that means clarify the premises and break them up, where doing so would help understand what they're really claiming. 

So let's look first at the BLMs argument which simply says, Conoco has a lease. These lands were set aside subject to valid rights, therefore its hands are tied. We gotta clarify first of all the conclusion. Its hands are tied. What does that mean? Well, basically the BLM is claiming, I can't do anything about Conoco. You know, my hands are tied. Don't hold me responsible. There's nothing I can do, okay. They're offering an excuse. Next premise two. 

These lands were set aside to subject to valid existing rights. Well, what is set aside mean? It means that you're not allowed to drill there. But subject evalid existing rights means that you are allowed to drill there if you've got a valid exisiting right. So, this premise can be restated as saying that if Conoco does have a valid existing right to drill, then the BLM must allow Conoco to drill. Okay. What about breaking up premises? What about premise 1? Well, that's one that I think we're going to have to break up. Because it says that Conoco has a lease that gives it the right to drill. And gives it, we already marked as an argument marker. Which suggests that the fact that Conoco has a lease is supposed to be a reason why it has a right to drill. So there's an argument implicit in that one sentence. 

And that means that we can take this whole argument and restate it something like this. Conoco has a lease, therefore Conoco has a valid right to drill. 

If Conoco has a valid right to drill, then the BLM must allow Conoco to drill. Therefore, the BLM must allow Conoco to drill. That is supposed to be the central force of the explicit premises and conclusions in the first part. Where the BLM gives its argument. The next part is Redford's response to this argument. Let's start with Redford's conclusion. What's he trying to show? He's trying to show the opposite of the BLM's argument. They're trying to show that their hands are tied. That is, that they can't stop Conoco from drilling. So Redford wants to show, that they can stop Conoco from drilling, or even that they must stop Conoco from drilling. 

So that's the conclusion he's trying to reach. What he says is sounds like Washington double speak to me. Well, that's 'cuz he's saying that people in Washington always say their hands are tied and can't get anything done. And he's going to argue that their hands aren't tied because they can and must stop Conoco from drilling. So we can replace the conclusion simply with the claim that the BLM must stop Conoco from drilling. 

Now we know how the argument ends. 

So let's take those premises and conclusion and number them pretty high, so that we can leave some room for the other premises that come before them. 

The next thing we need to do, is to get an argument for that central premise. Conoco does not have any valid right to drill. No here's what Redford said that the leases were originally issued without sufficient environmental study or public input, and in deciding to issue a permit now, the BLM didn't conduct a full analysis. 

Notice that they're two parts. To these claims. One is about the leases and the other is about the permit. Because in order to have a valid right to drill, Conoco needs to have a lease and a permit. Redford argues that there are problems with both the lease and the permit. But the considerations are a little different. So we need to separate those two parts into different arguments. The first part of this argument concerns the leases. He says that the leases were originally issued without sufficient environmental study or public input. Therefore, none of the leases conveyed a valid right to drill. 

Then the second part has to do with the permit. 

In deciding to issue a permit to drill now, the BLM did not conduct a full analysis therefore, none of the permits conveyed a valid right to drill. And the idea of the argument is going to be that the leases don't give them a right and the permits don't give them a right, so they ain't got no right. Wow, but that premise in that argument to show that the permit's not valid is a long premise with lots of different parts so we need to break it up. And we can figure out how to break it up by looking at the argument markers in the part of the passage that in effect constitute that premise. We know that there's a premise marker at the beginning. Once more, a discounting term. But, on the basis of, is an argument marker. Even, is a discounting term. And that breaks that long premise into parts so we can break them into A, the BLM did not conduct a full analysis of the environmental impacts of drilling on these incomparable lands. No full analysis. B, the BLM determined that there would be no significant environmental harm, okay? C, the BLM conducted only an abbrevieated review of the envorimental harm. And D, the BLM didn't even look at drilling on other federal leases. What about B? The BLM determined there would be no significant environmental impact. Well, that's what Redford opposes so that's not going to be part of his argument. How do the other three claims fit together, which is a reason for which? Well, now we're into a different step, namely organize the parts. And it's not completely clear. But it seems like Redford has 2 separate complaints. One is that the BLM did not look sufficiently hard at the environmental impact at this particular site the [UNKNOWN] plateau. The other complaint is that they didn't do a comparative analysis. And look at other leases on other federal lands to see, you know, what happens when drilling was allowed there. And when permits were issued in those other circumstances. So one claim is about this particular site and the other claim is a lack of comparison to other sites. 

These two points become even clearer in the next paragraph, if you remember that. There he said, first, I've spent considerable time on these extraordinary lands for years, and I know that an oil rig in their midst would have a major impact. 

So there, he's talking about the impact on this particular site on these particular lands. But right after that, he says, what's more. Indicating it's a separate argument, what's more. Conoco wants to drill a well to find oil. Inevitably, more rigs, more roads. New pipelines, toxic waste. And bright lights would follow to get the oil out. 

There he seems to be suggesting if he had just looked over at the other leases, you'd find that when you allow oil drilling a lot more happens than you ever expected to begin with. I'm, of course, not agreeing with this. It might be true or it might not. My point is that, this is the structure of Redford's own claims that make up his own argument. So there are two separate ways in which the review failed to be full. The first is that the BLM conducted only an abbreviated review, in the sense that they didn't look carefully at this particular site itself. And the second, is that the BLM didn't look at drilling in other places. Therefore, the conclusion is the BLM did not conduct a full analysis, that seems to be what Redford's saying in this particular sentence. Now let's bring it all together and clean it up a little bit in the process. One, all of Conoco's leases were originally issued without sufficient environmental study or public input. That's supposed to support two, none of Conoco's leases give it a valid right to drill. 

Then three, the BLM conducted an abbreviated review, they didn't look as carefully as they should've at the lands. Four, the BLM didn't look at drilling on lands under the other federal leases. This is the comparative claim. And those two are supposed to support five. The BLM did not conduct a full analysis. And whats that's supposed to show is that, six, its permit does not give Conoco a valid right to drill. 

Therefore, seven which is supposed to follow from two and six. Conoco does not have a valid right to drill. A, if Conoco does not have a valid right to drill then the BLM must not allow Conoco to drill. Therefore, the BLM must not allow Conoco to drill. Make sense? Seem fair? Hope so. I think it's a pretty good reconstruction of what Redford had in mind. 

下一阶段就是 这就意味着要阐明所有的前提条件 并一一击破它们 这样才能够帮助我们理解它们到底表达了什么 

所以首先我们看一下BLM (美国土地管理局) 的论据 它宣称 Conoco (康诺克石油公司) 有一份租赁合同 他们有正当的权利将这片土地闲置 因此  首先我们将要澄清结论 （BLM）束手无策 这是什么意思呢？ 主要的情形是 BLM宣称它对Conoco公司束手无策 你明白的 我被制约着 不要让我负责任 我什么也做不了 你明白的 他们在提供一个借口 下一个前提是第二个借口 

他们有正当权利对这片土地另作安排 那么 另作安排 (set aside) 意味着什么？这就意味着你在那钻孔 是被禁止的 但享有有效的现有权利又意味着如果你获准拥有了这个权利 你就可以在那儿钻孔 所以 这个前提就可以被重新陈述为 如果Conoco公司的确获得了有效的  可钻孔权利 那么BLM就必须允许Conoco的钻孔作业 好的 我们要怎么击破这些前提呢？ 那么如果是 击破前提1？ 嗯 这是我想我们必须攻破的一个前提 因为它声称Conoco公司有这样一份租约允许它进行钻孔作业 我们已经将之视作一个论点 这提示了Conoco拥有一份租约的事实 也许就是它之所以有权钻孔的理由 所以 这就是那一句话里没有明确表达的论据 

而这 这意味着我们可以拿来这整个论据这样去重述它 Conoco有一份租约 因此Conoco有正当权利钻孔作业 

如果Conoco有正当权利钻孔作业 那BLM (土地管理局) 必须允许它 因此 BLM必须允许Conoco钻孔作业 在BLM给出的论据里 这就是第一部分明确的前提和结论中的 着力点 第二部分则是雷德福关于这个论据的回应 我们从雷德福的结论开始 看看他到底想表明什么 他在试图表明与BLM论据恰恰相反的一面 BLM想要表明自己受到约束 也即 他们无力阻止Conoco的钻孔行为 所以雷德福想要表明的是 BLM可以阻止 或是甚至他们必须阻止Conoco公司的钻孔行为 

所以这就是雷德福想要达到的结论 他说的听上去像两个华盛顿人在对我说话 好吧 那是因为他说华盛顿人总是 说受到限制 办不到什么的 而他要做的是论证他们并非如此 因为他们完全能够且必须阻止Conoco公司的钻孔行为 这样我们可以用 BLM必须阻止Conoco的钻孔行为 这么简短的一个声明来代替结论了 

现在我们知道论据是怎么结束的了 

那么现在我们把这些前提和结论编上号 这样就给它们之前的一些假设留了一些空间 

接下来我们要做的 就是为中心前提找到论据 Conoco公司没有任何钻孔的正当权利 这就是雷德福说的租约 最初于没有充分进行环境研究和公众知晓不足情况下发布的 而现在决定颁布许可证 BLM也没有进行详尽的分析 

注意到声明 是由两部分组成 一个是关于租约 另一个是关于许可证 因为为了获得钻孔的合法许可 Conoco公司需要一份租约和一个许可证 雷德福论证关于租约和许可证都是存在问题的 但是考虑的方面又有所区别 所以我们需要将这两部分分为不同的论点 论证的第一部分涉及到租赁合同 他说合同的发布是缺少 “（先进行）充分的环境调查或公共投入” 因此 所有这些租赁合同都不能赋予其正当的钻孔权利 

而第二部分则与许可证有关 

在决定颁发许可证之时 BLM并没有进行 详尽的分析 因此 所有的许可证也不能赋予其正当的钻探权利 这样论证的焦点就变成了 租约没有赋予他们这样的权利 许可证也没有 所以他们没有权利钻孔 哇哦 但论点里试图显示许可证无效的前提 是一个相当成的前提 由许多不同的部分组成 所以现在我们要拆解它 通过阅读文章中 实际组成前提的那一部分文字 我们能够弄清楚怎样去拆解它 一开始我们知道那就是前提的标记 再一次 一个不被理会的术语 但是 基于这点的 是一个论点 即使 是一个不被注意的术语 这便将这一长长的前提拆解为A BLM没有对在这些不可比较的土地上进行钻探的环境影响 进行详尽的分析 没有详细分析 B BLM 认定不会有什么严重的环境破坏 是这样吗？ C BLM只进行了关于环境破坏的简短回顾 和D BLM甚至看都没看其他联邦租约里的钻孔条文 那B呢？ BLM断定不会有什么严重的环境破坏 不过 这是雷德福提出反对意见的 所以这不会是他论证中的 一部分 其他三条断言是怎样一一匹配的 哪一条是哪一条的理由？ 好的 现在我们进入了一个新的环节 即组织各个部分 而这并不那么清晰 但似乎雷德福 有两个可控诉之处 其一是 BLM没有充分研究环境影响 之于这一片高原上的 这个著名的sin函数 特殊区域 另一个申诉是 他们没有做一个够分量的分析 并参照联邦内其他土地的其他租约去 观察 嗯 当钻孔开采被允许时那些土地发生了什么 以及许可证应当在怎样的情形下才可以被颁布 所以一个声明是关于这一块地方 而另一个声明则是缺少与其他地方的对比 

这两点在接下来的一段中 变得越来越清晰 如果你们还记得的话 在那段中 他说 首先 我耗费了数以年计长的时间 在这片不同寻常的土地上 我知道有一架油井钻探设备就在它们其中 这将带来重大的影响 

所以在那一段里 他在解释这些影响 关于这个位置 关于这些特定的土地 但就在这之后 他说 还有 还有 暗示了另一个论点的存在 Conoco公司想要钻一口井去寻找石油 不可避免地 更多的钻探设备 更多的公路 新的管道 有毒的废弃物 为了获取石油还将有强光紧随 

这里他似乎在提示如果我们曾仔细看过其他的租赁协议的话 会发现一旦我们开发石油钻探 会有超出我们预期的种种问题出现 首先 我 当然是不同意这点的 这也许是真的也许有假 我的观点是 这是一个框架 存在于雷德福的宣称中 并构成了他自己的论据 所以这里有两种方式使得这一回顾不够完整 首先是 BLM仅仅进行的简短的回顾  以一种对于该地不够细致的意义而言 以及第二个 是  BLM没有考察其他地方的石油钻探情况 因此 结论就是BLM没有 像雷德福在这一句所说的那样 进行一项全面的分析  现在 我们把它们凑到一起 在这个过程中进行一下梳理 一 所以Conoco公司的租赁合同都是最初发布于 没有充分环境调研或公共投入情形下的 这将支持第二点 Conoco公司的所有 租约都没有赋予它合法的权利去钻探 

接着 第三点 BLM进行了一项简短的回顾 他们并未像他们本应该的那样仔细地考察 四 BLM没有在其他联邦租赁合同下考察那些土地上的钻探情况 这是有可比性的断言 而这两条将支持第五点 BLM没有做全面的分析 这就表明 第六点 它的许可证没有给Conoco公司合法的钻探权利 

因此 第七点由第二点和第六点综合而来  即 Conoco公司没有合法权利钻探 A 如果Conoco公司没有合法权利钻探 那么BLM就不应该允许Conoco进行钻探 因此 BLM不应当允许Conoco公司的钻孔行为 讲得通了吧？看上去清晰了吧？ 希望如此 我想 这是对于雷福德脑海中的想法一个相当棒的重组 

### an example of reconstruction (part 3)

As you probably noticed already, these arguments are not valid yet. So, we need to go to the next stage, and fill in the gaps with suppressed premises. 

Let's do that now. Let's start with the BLM's argument. 

Is the argument from 1 to 2 valid? Is it possible that Conoco has a lease, but it doesn't have a valid right to drill? Well, sure. And so, that argument's not valid. What do we need to add, to make it valid? Well, we can add a very simple suppressed premise. If Conoco does have a lease then it has a valid right to drill. If you add that to that premise that they do have a lease, then it'll be a valid argument to the conclusion that they have a valid right to drill. Next, is the argument from 2 and 3 to 4 valid? Yes, because it's not possible that Conoco has a valid right to drill. And also, if they have a valid right to drill, then the BLM must allow them to drill. And it not be true that the BLM must allow them to drill. So, we can take this part of the argument. Which is really the BLM's argument. But it's in Redford's passage. And reconstruct it like this. Conoco has a lease. If they have a lease, then they have a valid right to drill. So they have a valid right to drill. And if they have a valid right to drill, then the BLM has to allow them to drill. So the BLM has to allow them to drill. Now we're ready for Redford's own argument. His goal is to refute the premise that we had to add to the BLM argument in order to make that argument valid. In the previous lecture, we saw that a lot of people suppress premises that are questionable. And Redford wants to show how questionable this one is. He's not going to let them get away with that old trick. Starting with 1 and 2, is the argument from 1 to 2 valid? 

No, because it's possible that the premise is true and the conclusion false. 

So what do we need to add to make it valid? Well, what we need to add is suppressed premise. 

And that suppressed premise basically says, no lease that is made without sufficient environmental study. And public input is valid. Or conveys a valid right to drill. Then, we have a valid argument from that premise plus 1 to the conclusion 2 that none of Conoco's leases give it a valid right to drill. Next comes the step from 3 and 4 to 5. Is that valid? No. 3 and 4 say that they conducted an abbreviated review and they didn't look at drilling on lands and other federal leases. 

But those might be true and it still not be true that they didn't conduct a full analysis. To explain how you get 5 out of 3 and 4, we have to add another suppressed premise. And that premise can simply say, an analysis is not full if it's abbreviated. And if it doesn't look at drilling on lands in other federal leases. Notice that I used the word, and, instead of, or, in the suppressed premise. And the reason is that I want to make Redford's argument look as good as possible. And his premise is going to be more defensible if he uses and instead of or. Because with and, the premise means that the review's not full if it's, has both of those problems. Whereas if you have or. It says that the review's not full if it has either one or the other of those problems. Now some people might say, if it's only got one of those problems, it's still a full review. You know, it's a little problem. It's a little flaw. But if it's got both of those problems, then Redford's on stronger ground in saying, together they show but that's not a full review. So if I want to make his premise look good, and that's part of the point, then I want to use and in the suppressed premise here instead of or. What about the step from 5 to 6, is that valid? No, here we need a suppressed premise too. Which one? Well, we could just add, that if the BLM did not conduct a full analysis of the environmental impact, then the permit does not give the permit holder a valid right to drill, because the process by which they obtained the permit is not a proper process. Next, what about the move from 2 and 6 to 7? 2 says that Conoco doesn't have a lease that gives it a valid right to drill. And 6 says that Conoco doesn't have a permit that gives it a valid right to drill. 

Is it possible that both of those are true, and yet the conclusion's false and Conoco does have a valid right to drill? Well yeah, if there were some other way for it to get a valid right to drill. So, to make that argument valid, we have to add another suppressed premise which says, basically, you know, if the lease and the permit don't give it a valid right to drill, it ain't got none. More formally, and more stilted, we can add a suppressed premise that says. If none of Conoco's leases gives it a valid right to drill, and Conoco's permit does not give Conoco a valid right to drill, then Conoco does not have a valid right to drill. And that should make that step of the argument valid. 

There's only one left, the step from 7 and 8 to 9. Is that valid? Yeah. It's not possible that Conoco doesn't have a valid right to drill, and if they don't have a valid right to drill, then the BLM must not allow them to drill and it not be true that the BLM must not allow Conoco to drill. So, that's valid and we don't have to add any suppressed premise to that one. 

And now we can take all these different explicit premises and conclusions, and put them together with a suppressed premises that we just talked about. And we end up with this final reconstruction. 1, all of Conoco's leases were originally issued without sufficient environmental study or public input. 2, no leases that were originally issued without sufficient environmental study or public input give the leaseholder a valid right to drill. Therefore, none of Conoco's leases give it a valid right to drill. 4, the BLM conducted an abbreviated review. 5, the BLM didn't look at drilling on lands under other federal leases. 6, an analysis is not full if it's abbreviated and it does not look at drilling on lands under other federal leases. Therefore 7, the BLM did not conduct a full analysis of the environmental impacts of drilling on these incomparable lands. 8, if the BLM does not conduct a full analysis of the environmental impacts of drilling in these incomparable lands, before issuing a permit, then, that permit does not give the permit holder a valid right to drill. 

Therefore 9, Conoco's permit does not give Conoco a valid right to drill. 

10, if none of Conoco's leases gives it a valid right to drill and Conoco's permit does not give Conoco a valid right to drill, then Conoco does not have a valid right to drill. Therefore 11, Conoco does not have a valid right to drill. 

12, if Conoco does not have a valid right to drill, then the BLM must not allow Conoco to drill. Therefore 13. The BLM must not allow Conoco to drill. 

Of course, other reconstructions could be perfectly fine. Even if they differ in a few details. Because not every step in this process is purely mechanical. So it doesn't always yield exactly the same results every time. But I hope that this reconstruction seems plausible, as a guess at what was going on in Redford's mind. And the reasons that he had for thinking that the BLM should stop the drilling. If we want, we can check to make sure the structure makes sense, by trying to diagram it. So here's a diagram that I made of the structure of the argument that I just reconstructed. 

To the left, you see 1 plus 2, and an underline under it. Saying that those premises work together in a joint structure. And an arrow to the conclusion from those two premises, namely 3. 

Then to the right of that, you see that 4, 5, and 6 are joined. 4 plus 5 plus 6 and an underline with an arrow to 7 because that's the conclusion that those three premises support. 7 plus 8 is then underlined to show they work jointly to lead to the conclusion 9. So there's an arrow to 9. And then there's a long underline between 3, 9, and 10. That other supressed premise that was added. That shows that 3, 9, and 10 work together jointly, and lead to the conclusion 11. And then 11 works together with 12, so you have 11 plus 12, and that's underlined with an arrow to 13. Now the fact that we can draw this diagram confirms that the argument structure makes sense. 

Now, let's see whether you can do it yourself in the exercises. 

你们可能已经注意到了 这些论点目前还是无效的 所以我们需要进行下一步 让我们用隐含前提来解决这个问题 

我们现在就来看看BLM的论证 

从1到2的论证是正确的吗？ 有没有可能Conoco公司持有租约 但还是没有合法钻探的权利呢？ 你看 当然有这种可能 所以该论点是无效的 我们应该补充点什么使它有效呢？ 我们可以加入一个隐含条件 如果Conoco的确持有合同 那么它就有合法的钻探权利 如果把他们拥有合同的前提放进去 就能推导出有合法钻探权利这个结论 下一步 以条件2和3 能够得出4的结论吗 可以 因为Conoco不可能有合法钻探的权利 而且如果他们有权利 那么BLM的就要允许他们钻探 那么BLM必须允许他们钻探 所以我们可以采用这一部分论证 就是BLM的论证 它是Redford的文章 然后这样子重组它 Conoco持有租赁合同 如果他们有合同 他们就可以合法钻探 所以他们钻探是合法的 而既然他们可以合法钻探 那么BLM必须批准 所以BLM必须批准他们进行钻探作业 现在我们来看一下雷福德自己的论证 他的目标是反驳我们所用的这个前提 而该前提成立才能使论证成立 300年里 上节课中 我们看到许多人会 隐藏有问题的前提 而Redford则想指出这个前提有多可疑 他可不打算让这些老把戏得逞 再看一看1和2 可以从1有效地推出2吗？ 

不能 因为前提有可能真而结论却为假 

所以我们应该补充些什么来使它有效呢？ 答案是 我们可以加入一个隐含前提 

这个隐含前提基本上就是在说  租赁合同是建立于充足的环境研究之上的 公众民意研究之上 才是合法的 才能赋予合法的钻探权 然后 将这个前提和第一条合并 我们才能得出 第二条的结论 Conoco公司的租约不能赋予其合法钻探权 下一步 从3和4可以推导到5吗 不是的 3和4说的是他们仅进行了一项简短的评审 而且他们并没有考察其他关于陆地钻探的联邦租约 

这几个命题可能是真的 而仍然不能断言他们没有进行全面分析 要解释从3和4推导到5的论证过程 我们需要添加另一个隐含前提 这个前提便是 如果一项考察是简略的 那么它就不会是全面的 且如果它没有考察其他联邦租约关于陆地钻探的规定 注意 我在隐含前提里用了 且 这个词 而不是 或  因为我想让 雷福德的论证尽可能好 如果他在前提里使用 且 而不是 或 这个前提会更站得住脚  因为前提里用 且 这个词 表示该考察 有这两项缺点 所以它不是全面的  反之 如果你使用 或 那语义就变成了 这项考察不全面 是因为它可能有其中的某一个缺陷 有人就会说 如果它只有一项缺陷 那它仍然是个完整的考察 你看 一点小麻烦而已 只是一点点瑕疵 而有两项缺点时 如果雷福德声称 两项缺陷共同表明了这次考察是不全面的 那么该论证会更有力 所以如果我想让他的前提看上去更好 我会在隐含前提里使用 且 而不是 或  那么如果是 从5可以推导至6吗？不行 我们同样需要一个隐含前提 哪一个呢？ 我们可以说 如果BLM没有 全面分析其环境影响 那么该许可证 则没有赋予许可证持有者合法钻探的权利 因为 其取得许可证没有经过适当程序 下一步 从2和6推导到7的过程怎么样 第二点说的是Conoco公司没有租约来保证其合法钻探权 而第六点说的是Conoco没有 合法钻探的许可证 

有没有可能两者同时为真 但 其结论为假 而Conoco公司确实拥有合法钻探权呢？ 有可能 如果还能通过其他渠道获取合法钻探权的话 所以 如果要令这个论证成立 我们还需要添加另一个隐含前提 就是说 你看 如果该租约 和许可证都无法保证合法钻探权 那就没有合法钻探权 我们可以添加一个更正式更呆板的隐含前提 如果租约没有赋予Conoco公司 合法钻探权 而Conoco公司所持许可证 也没有赋予其钻探权 那么Conoco公司则不具有合法权利 进行钻探作业 这样该论证的这些步骤就是有效的了 

最后一个 从第七第八条推出第九条 这个论证有效吗？ 是的 Conoco公司不可能没有合法钻探权 如果他们没有 合法钻探权的话 BLM就不应当批准 其作业 而BLM不应当允许Conoco公司作业这个命题为伪 所以这是有效论证 我们不需要添加任何隐藏前提了 

现在我们可以把所有明确的前提和结论 跟我们刚刚讨论的隐含前提合并起来 可以得到一个最终重组版本 1 Conoco公司的租约发放时 当初签发这些租约的时候 并没有经过充分的环境调查或公共投入 2 租约在缺乏充足环境研究或 民意调查情况下 无法赋予租赁人合法钻探权 因此 Conoco公司的租约无法保证合法钻探权 4 BLM进行了一项 简短的考察 5 BLM没有考察其他联邦租约关于陆地钻探的规定 6 如果一向考察是简略的 而又 没有考察其他联邦租约关于陆地钻探的规定 那就不是全面的 所以 7 BLM没有全面分析 钻探会对这片独一无二的土地造成的环境影响 8 如果BLM没有全面分析 钻探会对这片独一无二的土地造成的环境影响 仍发放了许可证 那么该许可证 无法赋予持有者合法钻探权 

所以 9 Conoco公司的许可证无法赋予Conoco合法钻探权 

10 如果租约没有赋予Conoco公司 合法钻探权 而Conoco公司所持许可证 也没有赋予其钻探权 那么 即 Conoco公司没有合法权利钻探 所以 11 Conoco公司没有合法权利钻探 

12 如果Conoco公司没有合法权利 进行钻探 那么BLM就不应该允许Conoco进行钻探 所以 13 BLM不应当允许Conoco公司进行钻探作业 

当然了 完全可以进行其它重组 有一些细节上的不同也没有关系 因为这里每一步都不是纯粹机械的过程 所以也许每次得到的结果也不尽相同 但愿我这个重组版本看起来可信 这是我对雷福德心思的猜测 以及我认为他觉得BLM应该叫停钻探的原因 如果愿意的话 我们也可以 试着把整个结构画成图 看看它是否合理 这里是我画的表 画的是我刚讲的论证重组的结构 

左边是第1条和第2条 这里有条下划线 即是说这两个条件共同构成一个节点 从两个条件处起 有一个箭头指向结论 也就是第3点 

然后往右边看 4 5 6条相连 4 5 6条和一条下划线 箭头指向7 因为第7是以上三个前提支持的结论 第7和第8条的下划线说明这两个条件共同导向结论 第9条 所以箭头指向第9条 第3 第9和第10之间有一条长下划线 在这儿加入另一条隐含前提 表示第3 第9 第10条共同导致第11条结论 第11条和第12条合并 第11条加第12条 下划线 箭头指向第13条 我们可以画这样一个 图表来检查的论证结构是否正确 

现在你们可以自己练习一下
