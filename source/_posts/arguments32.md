# Causal Reasoning

CONTENT: This module will focus on how to decide what causes what. Students will learn how to distinguish necessary conditions from sufficient conditions and how to use data to test hypotheses about what is and what is not a necessary condition or a sufficient condition. Then we will distinguish causation from correlation (or concomitant variation) and explain the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc. It is sad that some diners had to die to make this lesson possible, as you will see.

LEARNING OUTCOMES: By the end of this week’s material you will be able to do:

analyze causal reasoning
distinguish necessary from sufficient conditions
determine what is necessary or sufficient for what
separate causation from correlation
OPTIONAL READING: If you want more examples or more detailed discussions of these topics, we recommend Understanding Arguments, Ninth Edition, Chapter 10.

## What Is a Cause?

### Causal Reasoning

Another kind of inductive argument concerns causes or causal reasoning. 

Now, we think about causes all the time in everyday life. 

Suppose that all of a sudden your computer screen goes black. 

Whoa. What made that happen? Was it the Coursera website going down, or is there some problem with your computer, or was I just playing a trick on you? Well, you need to know that in order to figure out whether or not you need to get your computer fixed. Or suppose that, make a cup of coffee. I love a good cup of coffee. that's disgusting. What went wrong? What made it taste so bad? There must be something in the coffee that made it taste bad. But what was it? What caused that horrible taste? Or think about a court room. A lawsuit. Someone's found guilty of murder. Well, to be found guilty of murder, you have to show that they are the one that caused the death. That their action, pulling the trigger, putting the poison in the food, whatever, caused the death. 

And whether you send them to prison for a long time depends on that causal judgement. So we gotta get causal judgement straight. 

The causal judgements cannot be certain. We can't know, with absolute certainty, what causes what. It's just not like that in life. 

That's why we need inductive arguments, in order to support these causal judgments that play such a big role in all of our lives. 

Okay. So we need inductive arguments to support causal claims. But how does that work? To get straight on that, we need to think a little bit about causation. 

Causal claims are about individual events. One event causes another event. For example, my phone is off but if I push this button on the bottom, then it turns on. 

Great. And if I push this button on the top, then it turns off. 

That particular event of me pushing the button on the bottom turned it on and the particular event of me turning, pushing the button on the top turned it off. But behind that connection between the particular events, lies a general rule. 

Every time I push the button on the bottom, it turns on. And every time I push the button on the top, it turns off. 

If it didn't hold as a general rule, it wouldn't be a causal relation. Right? So, how can we test general principles. That's going to be the topic for this whole week. 

The big questions going to be, which cases in the data, do we need to look at? 

And, how do we know, when we have enough data to really believe in a general principle? 

But the first thing we need to do is to draw an important distinction between two different types of general principles. Sometimes we say that one thing is a sufficient condition for another thing. And that means, basically, that whenever you have the first thing, you're also going to have the second thing. 

But sometimes we're going to claim that something is a necessary condition for the second thing. 

And, basically, again that means that if you don't have the first thing you're not going to have the second thing. 

And it's going to be crucial to distinguish sufficient conditions from necessary conditions because people confuse them all the time. And we need to get them straight, get them straight. So, let's start with a very simple example. First, 

being a whale is sufficient for being a mammal. 

Well, that's because every whale is a mammal, so if you've got something that's a whale, you know you've got something that's a mammal. Okay. 

But being a whale is necessary for being a sperm whale. If you're not a whale, you're not a sperm whale. You can't be a sperm whale without being a whale. 

So being a whale is necessary for being a sperm whale, and being a whale is sufficient for being a mammal. 

One way to illustrate this is to draw them into circles. 

So, if you know that there's a large group of mammals, that's a big circle. But within that is this set of whales, which is smaller than the mammals. But even within the whale's circle, there's a set of sperm whales. Then, you know that, being a whale, is sufficient for being a mammal because everything in the whale circle is in this mammal circle. And being a whale is necessary for being a sperm whale because everything that's not in the whale circle is also not in the sperm whale circle, because the sperm whale [INAUDIBLE] circle is totally inside the whale circle. Okay? 

Now let's try to formulate a definition of necessary and sufficient conditions a little more precisely. 

The definition for sufficient conditions and necessary conditions is a little different with events than it is with features. So we're going to give you two different versions and you can really use the one that applies to the case at hand. 

We can define a sufficient condition by saying that F is a sufficient condition for G, if and only if just in case. Whenever an event of type F happens, then an event of type G also happens. 

And to put it more appropriately for features, we can say that anything that has the feature F will also have the feature G. 

So in our whale example, anything that's a whale is also a mammal. 

Anything that has the feature of being a whale, also has the feature of being a mammal. 

So being a whale is sufficient for being a mammal. And we can do the same thing with necessary conditions. But you gotta put the negations in there. That's the only difference. 

F is a necessary condition for G if and only if, that is, just in case. 

Whenever an event of type F does not happen, 

then an event of type G also does not happen. By putting the negation on both sides, you turn into a necessary condition. And for features, we can say anything that does not have [INAUDIBLE] the feature F does not have the feature G. So back to our whale example, anything that is not a whale is not a sperm whale So being a whale is necessary for being a sperm whale. And that's how our definitions work. Now, since you took Propositional Logic a few years, a few year, a few weeks ago with [UNKNOWN] 

it might help to think of this as equivalent to the propositional forms. So you can think of F is sufficient for G, is like F, if F then G, or F horseshoe G. It's not really quite the same. It's different because you need quantifiers, but if you think of it that way, it won't hurt. And then, to say that F is necessary for G is kind of like saying, if not F, then not G. Or in symbols, not F horseshoe not G. And thinking of it along those lines is, is again, not quite right, because there are no quantifiers. But it's close enough and it might help you understand the distinction between sufficient conditions and necessary conditions. 

The same concepts apply in causal examples, but they're a little bit trickier to apply. And the main reason is that word whenever, because it's a quantifier and it applies to a restricted domain of discourse. Now, you don't know what that means because we haven't studied that yet. But the point is that it only holds whenever in a certain range of cases. Not just any old case. So to get to clear about that let's, let's look at an example. 

Striking this match. 

[SOUND] This match right here, right, is sufficient for lighting it. [SOUND] So, when I strike it, I light it. Okay? And striking the match on a rough surface is necessary for lighting it because if I strike it [SOUND] on a surface that's not rough, it doesn't light. 

[SOUND] So now we know that striking it is sufficient and striking it on a rough surface is necessary. But wait a minute. That can't be right. It can't be true that whenever you strike the match it lights because we know that when you strike it on a surface that's not rough, it doesn't light. So how do we get that striking it is sufficient for lighting it when we know that if you strike it on the wrong place [SOUND] it's not going to light. And the answer is that when we say whenever we strike it, we're taking it for granted, that we're talking about a normal match, maybe just this one, with the right chemicals on the end. And we're talking about striking it, we're talking about striking it in a certain way, in a certain place. So when we say whenever, we're saying whenever we strike it [SOUND] 

on that surface, then it will light. I mean, for example, if you were to take [SOUND] the match and you were to start with a regular match, but then dip it in the coffee, 

that still tastes horrible, then [SOUND] it won't light when you strike it because it's wet. So in causal cases you're always saying that within a certain range of circumstances 

it will hold. Whenever, in those circumstances, you strike the match, it will light. And the same point holds for necessary conditions. So, this match, this box, rough surface, it's not lighting. 

Well, why not? Because if you don't strike the match, it won't light. Right? No, that's not right either [SOUND] because if you take another match [SOUND] 

and you light it, then look, I can light this match without striking it. 

[SOUND] So it turns out that necessary conditions and sufficient conditions in causal cases have to be understood as holding as a general rule within appropriate circumstances. And that means that we have to change our definition of necessary conditions and sufficient conditions to make that clear. To be strictly true then, we need to, qualify the definition with the phrase in normal circumstances. And the, in normal circumstances tells us how the term whenever, applies. So then, F is a sufficient condition for G, if and only if, in normal circumstances whenever F happens, G also happens, or in normal circumstances, anything that's an F is also a G. And the same holds for necessary conditions 

F is a necessary condition for G, if and only if, just in case, or that's what this means, is that in normal circumstances, 

whenever F does not happen, G does not happen 

Or for features, in normal circumstances for normal cases, anything that's not an F is also not a G. 

Now of course what counts as normal circumstances is going to be a tricky term that the changes from case to case and this definition, applies in a lot of different kinds of cases. 

We already saw one case. That's the conceptual case. So let's look at that first. 

Being a whale is sufficient for being a mammal. Now, notice being a whale is not necessary for being a mammal because there's lots of mammals that aren't whales, like sea otters. 

And being a whale is necessary for being a sperm whale, bu it's not sufficient for being a sperm whale because there are lots of whales that aren't sperm whales. 

Okay? So that's a conceptual case. 

Then, we saw a causal case. Striking this match is sufficient for lighting it. 

And, striking this match on a rough surface is necessary for lighting it. Okay? But it also has the same distinction in the, in other kinds of cases. 

Here's a moral example. Torturing someone just for fun is sufficient for doing something wrong. Because torturing somebody just for fun is always wrong. You shouldn't do it, period. 

Or, at least, so someone might claim. I think so, at least. 

And doing something wrong is necessary for being punishable. 

Now, notice that torturing for fun is not necessary for doing something wrong because you can do wrong without torturing for fun. Okay? And doing something wrong is not sufficient for being punishable because you ought to get a fair trial before you're punished. If you do something wrong and didn't get a fair trial, you're not ready to be punished yet. 

but notice, I've now made some controversial claims here. Some people might say that doing something wrong is not really necessary for being punishable. Sometimes, we ought to punish people even when they didn't do something wrong. 

So when you get into the moral realm, 

it's going to be a little bit more controversial, and that shouldn't be surprising. 

In any case, the main point here is that we try to understand the claims that are being made, and in particular to distinguish the claim that something is sufficient from the claim that the thing is necessary. Okay? Distinguishing sufficient conditions from necessary conditions is crucial because if you mess these up you'll make all kinds of mistakes and arguments. So let's do a few examples, a few exercises, in order to be sure that you understand that before we look at the tests for sufficient conditions and necessary conditions. 

另一种归纳式推理着眼于原因 或者说因果推理  

当前，我们在日常生活中 时时关注着原因。 

假设突然之间，你的电脑 屏幕一片漆黑。 

我擦， 这怎么回事？ 是Coursera网站崩溃，是 电脑 出了问题，还是我不过 在整你？ 你需要明白原因 才能搞清楚 是否需不需要把 电脑送修 或者假设 冲一杯咖啡 我深爱着美好的咖啡 这杯好恶心。 哪里出了问题？ 什么让它如此不堪入口？ 咖啡里一定有什么让它 这么难喝。 它是什么？ 什么导致了那种诡异的味道？ 再或想想法庭。 一宗诉讼。 有人被指控谋杀。 额，要证实有罪，你必须 阐释他（她）们是造成死亡的人 他（她）们诸如叩响扳机，毒化 下毒 诸如此类 导致了死亡。 

同时，刑期是否很长 取决于那个因果判断， 所以我们需要保证因果判断逻辑有效 

因果推断没有绝对 我们不能绝对地认知 什么导致了什么 现实如此 

这就是我们需要归纳论证的原因 为了支持 如此重要的因果论证。 

好 所以我们需要归纳论证来支持 因果的论调。 但这怎么实现？ 要使之有效，我们需要想想因果关系 

因果论调针对独立事件 一个事件导致另一个事件 举个例子，我的手机关机，但如果我 按下面这个键，它随之打开。 

好 而如果我按上面 这个键，则它关闭。 

我按动下方键这一动作打开它，而 我按顶部按钮的动作 上面的键—关掉了它。 但是在独立事件联系的 背后有一条普遍规律。 

我每次按动底部按钮 它打开 而我每次按动上面的键 它关掉 

如果这不是普遍规律，它 就不是因果关系。 对么 所以 我们怎么能测证普遍原理？ 那将是这一整周的话题 

主要问题是 我们应该关注数据里的哪些样本？ 

以及，我们如何知道我们已有 足够的数据来真正相信普遍原理？ 

不过我们 首先要做的是对两种 不同的普遍原理作重要区分。 有时我们说一个因素是另一个 因素的充分条件 这基本意味着你只要有了第一因素， 你就会有第二因素 

但是有时我们要说一个因素是第二个的 必要条件。 

同样 这基本意味着 如果你没有 第一个因素你就不会有第二个。 

而区分充分条件和必要条件 至关重要 因为人们常常混淆二者 我们则需要把它们弄清，弄明白。 那 就从一个简单的例子开始 首先 

“是鲸鱼”是“是哺乳动物”的充分条件 

这是因为每条鲸鱼都是哺乳动物 所以如果你得到 一条鲸鱼，你明白你得到的是个哺乳动物。 好 

不过，是鲸鱼对于是抹香鲸是必要的。 如果你不是鲸鱼 你就不是抹香鲸 不是鲸鱼，你就做不了抹香鲸。 

所以“是鲸鱼”对于“是抹香鲸”是必要的 而是鲸鱼对于是哺乳动物是充分的。 

分析这个的一种方法是把它们 画入圈里。 

如果你知道有一大群哺乳动物 那就是个大圈。 但是它们之中是一群数目小于 哺乳动物数目的鲸鱼。 但是鲸鱼的圈里 还有一个抹香鲸的集合 这样 你就知道 “是鲸鱼”对于“是哺乳动物” 是充分的 因为所有鲸鱼圈里的个体在哺乳动物圈里 同样，是鲸鱼对于是抹香鲸是必要的 因为不在鲸鱼圈里的个体都不在 抹香鲸的圈里，因为抹香鲸圈 我构造了一个幂级数 然后进行了一些操作 完全在鲸鱼的圈里。 明白？ 

现在我们来给必要和充分条件 下个更精确的定义 

充分条件和必要条件的定义在事在点 在事在点有所不同 所以这里会给出两个不同的 角度 你就可以 使用适于手头事例的一个 

通过说明当且仅当在何种情形下F是G的充分条件 当且仅当 F类事件发生时 G类事件也会发生 

为了使之更适于特点 我们可以说 任何有F特点的都有G特点 

所以在我们的鲸鱼例子里，任何是 鲸鱼的都是哺乳动物。 

任何有（全部）鲸鱼特点的东西 都有哺乳动物特点 

所以“是鲸鱼”对于“是哺乳动物” 是充分的。 我们可以对必要条件做相同的事 但是你需要加否定词 这是唯一区别 

当且仅当如下情况，F是G的必要条件。 

只要F类的事件不发生 

G类型的事件也不发生。 通过在两端加否定词，你 把它转为了必要条件。 对于特点 我们可以说任何没有 我构造了一个幂级数 然后进行了一些操作 特点F的事物都没有特点G 所以回到我们的鲸鱼 例子 任何不是鲸鱼的 都不是抹香鲸。所以 “是鲸鱼”对于“是抹香鲸” 是必要的。 这就是我们的定义的含义。 现在，既然大家已经上命题逻辑课 好几年..好几年！好几周了。 这个著名的sin函数 

把它看作命题的形式会有助于你的理解 所以你可以把F对于G是充分条件看作 如果F则G，或者F属于G。 两者不完全相同。 不同在于你需要量词，但如果 你那样想也没问题。 同样 说F对于G是必要条件类似 说 如果不F则不G 或者用符号表达为 非F属于非G 顺着这条线往下想 不完全正确，因为没有量词。 不过瑕不掩瑜 这可以帮助你 理解充分条件和必要条件 的区别。 

相同的概念适用于 因果例子里 但这应用有些困难 而主要原因是“只要”一词，因为它 是一个量化词，应用于一定范围 的讨论中。 现在你不知道它意味着什么， 因为我们还没学过。 不过重点在于它只对于特定范围 的事例有效 而不仅是老事例 为了明白这个 我们来看一个例子 

划这个火柴 

【果壳教育无边界字幕组】翻译：卡诺上的泡沫 校对：霁蓝 审阅：霁蓝 就是这根火柴，对于点燃它是充分的。 【果壳教育无边界字幕组】翻译：卡诺上的泡沫 校对：霁蓝 审阅：霁蓝 所以，当我划它，我点燃它。 对吧？ 而 在粗糙面上划火柴 对于 点燃它 是必要的 因为如果我在 【果壳教育无边界字幕组】翻译：卡诺上的泡沫 校对：霁蓝 审阅：霁蓝 非粗糙面上划它 它不着 

【果壳教育无边界字幕组】翻译：卡诺上的泡沫 校对：霁蓝 审阅：霁蓝 所以现在我们知道划它是充分的 而 在糙面上划它 是必要的 不过 等一下 这不可能正确 不能说 只要划了火柴它就着 因为我们 知道当我们在非粗糙平面上划它时 它不着 所以我们知道当你在不合适的地方划火柴 它就不会着 我们怎么得出 【果壳教育无边界字幕组】翻译：卡诺上的泡沫 校对：霁蓝 审阅：霁蓝 划它对于点燃它是充分的？ 答案是当我们说 “我们只要划它” 我们默认 我们在讨论一根正常的火柴 或许就是 这一根，头上有合适的化学物质。 当我们讲划它 我们在说 以特定方式 在特定表面划它 所以当我们说“只要”，我们说 只要我们在那个表面上划了它， 【果壳教育无边界字幕组】翻译：卡诺上的泡沫 校对：霁蓝 审阅：霁蓝 

它就会点燃。我的意思是， 举个例子，如果你要拿 【果壳教育无边界字幕组】翻译：卡诺上的泡沫 校对：霁蓝 审阅：霁蓝 火柴，且以开始拿了 正常火柴 但随后在咖啡里浸它 

咖啡味道糟糕极了 【果壳教育无边界字幕组】翻译：卡诺上的泡沫 校对：霁蓝 审阅：霁蓝 你划它的时候它不会亮 因为它湿了 所以在因果判断情况里 你总是在说 在一定环境以内， 

它成立。 只要在那些情况下 你划了火柴 它就会着 对于必要条件这也相同。 所以 火柴 盒子和粗糙面不会 点燃火柴 

为何不着？ 因为如果你不划火柴 它 不会着 对吧？ 不，这也不对。 【果壳教育无边界字幕组】翻译：卡诺上的泡沫 校对：霁蓝 审阅：霁蓝 因为你可以拿另一根火柴 【果壳教育无边界字幕组】翻译：卡诺上的泡沫 校对：霁蓝 审阅：霁蓝 

并且点燃它 看 我可以不划 就点燃这根火柴 

【果壳教育无边界字幕组】翻译：卡诺上的泡沫 校对：霁蓝 审阅：霁蓝 如此看来因果案例中必要条件和 充分条件 必须被理解为在 适当情况下的普遍原理 这意味着我们需要改变我们对 必要条件和充分条件的定义来 使之更清晰 要想完全准确 我们需要用 “一般情况下” 来修饰 定义 “一般情况下” 告诉我们 我们“只要”一词怎么实现 这样一来 当且仅当在一般情况下 只要 则G发生，或者任何是F的也是G，则  又或者 在一般情况下 任何是F的事物也是G 同样 对必要条件也成立 

F是G的充分条件 当且仅当 一般情况下 

或者说特征，一般情况对于普通事物， 

或者从特征角度 一般情况下 则F是G的必要条件。 

当然 什么是一般情况 比较微妙 随着情况不断改变 可以应用于很多不同的情况 

我们已经看了一个例子 那是一个概念案例。 所以来先看它。 

是一条鲸鱼对是一个哺乳动物是充分的 注意是一条鲸鱼对于是一个 哺乳动物是必要的因为有很多非鲸鱼 的哺乳动物 比如海獭 

而是一条鲸鱼对于是一条抹香鲸是必要的 但它不对是一条抹香鲸 充分 因为有很多不是抹香鲸 的鲸鱼 

对吧？ 所以这是一个概念例子 

接下来我们看了一个因果例子。 划火柴对于点燃它是充分的 

而在粗糙平面上划火柴 对于点燃它是必要的 对吗？ 不过在其他类的例子中也有 相同的区分 

这里有一个道德事例 为快感而折磨人 对于做坏事是充分的。 因为为快感而折磨人永远是错的 插一句 你不该这么做 

或者 至少人们会这么说 起码我这么想 

而做坏事对于应被惩罚是必要的 

注意 虐待取乐不是做错事的 必要条件 因为错事可以是虐待取乐之外的事 对吗？ 做错事对应受惩罚不是充分条件 因为 在被惩罚前你应得到公正审判 如果你做了错事而没有得到 公正审判 你就尚未适于惩罚 

但注意 我刚刚发出了争议性论调 有人会说做错事对于 应受惩罚不是必要的 有时 即使人没有做错事我们也应该惩罚 

所以当你进入道德情况， 

事情会更有争议 而且 这没什么惊讶的 

任何情况下，这里的终点都是 我们试图理解做出的论断 特别要分清楚 声明某事充分 和必要的论断。 对吗？ 区分充分条件和必要条件是重要的，因为 如果你弄混这些，你会 陷身各种错误和争论。 所以我们先来做几个练习 来确保 在谈到充分条件和必要条件测试前 你理解了它们 

## Necessary and Sufficient Conditions

### Negative Sufficient Condition Tests

Now that we understand the distinction between sufficient conditions and necessary conditions, we need to ask how we can tell which conditions are necessary and which conditions are sufficient. 

So we're going to have one pair of tests for sufficient conditions, one pair of tests for necessary conditions. For each of these we're going to have a positive test and a negative test. So, for example, the negative test for sufficient conditions is going to tell you what's not a sufficient condition. The positive test for sufficient conditions is going to tell you what is a sufficient condition. 

One of these is going to be deductive, and the other is going to be inductive. 

So, let's go through these various tests one by one. 

First of all, you get, the negative version, of the sufficient condition test. Which basically says, that something, X, is not a sufficient condition, of something else, Y. If there is any case where X is present, and Y is absent. It don't have to be a lot of cases, just one. If there's any one case, where X is present and Y is absent, then that shows you that X is not sufficient for Y. This test is negative, because it tells you what is not a sufficient condition for Y. It does not tell you what is a sufficient condition for Y. 

Basically, it says that if there's one case where X is present and Y is absent, then that's a counterexample to the generalization that whenever X is present, Y is always present, because if Y is absent, it's not present. So we've now got basically a deductive argument against the generalization that whenever X is present, Y is present as well. 

And because it's deductive, that means it's not defeasible. If you had other cases, it doesn't matter. More information in the premises, the argument's still going to be valid. Because as long as you have one counterexample, that shows that X is not sufficient for Y, because it's not the case that whenever X is present, Y is present. To see how this negative sufficient condition works, let's go through an example. Now, the example we're going to talk about derives from the great comedy classic, Airplane! , with Leslie Nielsen. And so we've added a link that you can check out if you want. But I'll warn you, there's some offensive parts of this comedy. And you oughtta be ready for that. Partly to avoid those offensive parts, and also so that we can really get all the cases straight and specify them in the way we need to, we're going to use our own example, and we're going to call it the banquet. 

So what happens, is that they're a group of people, who are eating together. 

And they eat a full meal. They have a soup course, they have a main course. They have some wine. Then they had desert. And the meal goes pretty well until the end. Oh that was great, I loved the tomato soup, yeah. >> This fish is to die for. >> Yeah and this wine, oh my gosh, it was so good. >> I love the combination of both the fish and the red wine together. >> Yeah, it's, it's so sad that the dinner is over. 

Oh man, when I stood up my stomach started hurting. >> Yeah, mine did too. >> Oh, oh man [LAUGH]. >> Oh, [COUGH]. [CROSSTALK] >> [CROSSTALK] >> [SOUND] >> Oh, man. What's making them all feel this way? >> The question is, what caused them to die? So we check a number of different things. They weren't shot. They weren't stabbed. 

There was poison. 

Where was the poison? We checked their water glasses and we checked for injection points, if somebody shot the poison through a syringe. None of that, so we figure the poison must have gotten to them through the food. And now, we need to look at all the different people, who were at the banquet, and what each particular person ate at the banquet, in order to figure out which of these different food items was the one that killed them. 

So we have a little chart. Ann went to the banquet, Barney went to the banquet and Cathy went to the banquet. 

So each of the rows on this chart indicates a different diner, a different person who ate at the banquet. 

Each of the columns indicates what they ate or drank. So one column's for the soup course. One column's for the main course. One column's for the wine. One's for the dessert. And then of course, the last column to the right, tells you whether they lived or died. And what we need to figure out, is which of those food items or drinks, is what caused their death. We're going to use the letter Y, to refer to the target feature, or the effect, the thing that is caused. And we're going to use the letter X to refer to the different candidates for the cause. And our question is, which candidate X is sufficient for the target Y? 

And the table, with all the diners and all the courses, represents all of the data that we have available to us to answer that question. So let's look first at the very first course, the soup course. What does the soup course show us? 

Does it show us that anything is not sufficient for death? 

Yes. 

Shows tomato soup is not sufficient for death. Why? Because Ann had tomato soup and she didn't die. So it's not true that whenever you have tomato soup, you die, since Ann had tomato soup and did not die. 

So, that candidate X, tomato soup, is not sufficient for the target Y death. 

Cathy shows the same thing, she shows that tomato soup is not sufficient for death. Now, what do we learn from the main course? 

Do we learn that anything is not sufficient for death? Yes. 

We learned that chicken is not sufficient for death, because Anne has chicken, and doesn't die. 

And what does Cathy tell us is not sufficient for death? 

The case of Cathy, tells us the beef is not sufficient for death. 

So now we have a whole list of things that have been ruled out as sufficient conditions, tomato soup, chicken, and beef. 

And what about the wine course? 

What does Ann tell us in the wine course? Tells us that white wine is not sufficient for death. 

And what does Cathy tell us in the wine course? Red wine is not sufficient for death. 

And notice, that it's Ann and Cathy that are giving us all this information about what's not sufficient, and that's because they didn't die. So anything that they ate or drank cannot be sufficient for death. But Barney did die. So, the things that he ate and drank, still might be sufficient for death. They're not ruled out by the negative sufficient condition test. Of course, tomato soup is ruled out by the other cases, and red wine was ruled out by Cathy. But still, what about fish? Could fish be sufficient for death? It's not ruled out, right? It's not ruled out by the negative sufficient condition test because there's no case in this data where somebody eats fish and doesn't die. 

But does that mean that eating fish is sufficient for death? 

No,' because this is just the negative sufficient condition test. It tells you what's not sufficient, it doesn't tell you what is sufficient, okay? 

But still, we want to look at the rest of the chart and figure out, is there anything else that's not ruled out as a sufficient condition? 

Well, pie is ruled out as a sufficient condition,' because Ann had pie, but is still alive. Cathy shows that ice cream is not a sufficient condition for death. But Cake still might be a sufficient condition for death, for all we've read. So now, we've got two candidates, fish and cake, still might be sufficient conditions for death. They're not ruled out by the negative sufficient condition test. But that doesn't mean they are sufficient for death. 

In order to conclude that they are sufficient conditions for death, we need to apply not the negative sufficient condition test, but instead the positive sufficient condition test. 

既然我们了解了充分条件和必要条件 这两者间的不同 我们需要问 怎样区分充分条件和必要条件 

所以接下来我们要用到一对针对充分条件的测试 和一对针对必要条件的测试 每组测试中 我们都会有一个肯定性检验和一个否定性检验 比如说 充分条件的否定性检验 告诉你什么不是充分条件 充分条件的肯定性检验 将告诉你怎样才算一个充分条件 

一个是演绎推断得来 另一个则用到归纳 

接下来 我们就逐条研究这些测试方法 

首先 是充分条件的否定性检验 也即 某物X不是另一物Y的充分条件 如果存在任何一种情况 X出现了而Y没有 不需要太多例子 一个就足够 只要出现一次 X出现而Y没有 那么 我们就知道X不是Y的充分条件 这是否定性检验 因为它表明什么不是Y的充分条件 它没告诉你Y的充分条件是什么 

也就是说 它表明 只要存在一例 X出现而Y不出现的情况 那么该例子就是 无论何时X存在Y就存在 这个概括的反例 因为当Y没出现的时候 就不成立 所以我们得到了一个推理论证 反驳了无论何时X存在Y就存在 这个概括 

而且因为由演绎得来 便意味着它是不可废止的 如果你有其他例子 也没关系 (即使) 前提中提供了更多信息 论证仍是有效的 因为只要你有一个反例 就表明 X不是Y的充分条件 因为它并不符合 只要有X就有Y (这个概括) 为了弄明白 这个充分条件的否定性检验 具体怎么用 我们来看一个例子 我们将讨论的例子来自于  莱斯利·尼尔森出演的经典喜剧 《空前绝后满天飞》 我们附了一条链接 如果你愿意可以去看看 不过我提醒大家 喜剧里包含了一些令人不快的部分 这点请做好准备 部分原因是 为了避开这些令人不快的 同时也使我们能直观体会这些例子 并根据我们的需要去描述它们 我们要用自己的例子 就叫它宴会好了 那么发生了什么 有这么一群人在一起吃饭 他们享用了一套全餐 

有汤 有主菜 

还有些酒 他们还用了点心 这顿饭从头至尾都那么棒 太棒了 我爱极了这番茄汤 — 这鱼真是要命地美味 — 是的 还有酒 老天 这口感太好了 — 我爱极了鱼和红酒 这样的搭配 — 是啊 真遗憾晚餐结束了 天 我一站起来胃都要炸了 

— 就是啊 我的也是 — 天啊 [笑声]  — 哈哈 噢 [COUGH].[咳嗽] [CROSSTALK][CROSSTALK] — [CROSSTALK][CROSSTALK] — [声音] — 问题是 什么导致了他们的死亡？ 我们来检查下各种可能性 他们没有遭到枪击 没有被刀子刺到 那里有些毒药 

毒药在哪里？ 

我们检查了他们的水杯 检查了皮肤表面是否留有针孔 如果是有人用注射器注射毒药的话 没有针孔的痕迹 所以我们分析毒药一定是通过食物进入体内的 现在 我们要看看这些参加了宴会的人 看看每一个人 到底都吃了什么 以便找出 究竟是哪种食物毒死了他们 这儿我们画了一张表 

安 巴尼和凯茜都参加了宴会  表格中的每一行代表了 

不同的客人 在宴会吃了东西的人 每一列表示他们吃过或饮用过的东西 

故有一列表示汤 有一列表示主菜 有一列表示酒 还有一列表示点心 当然 最右边的一列 告诉我们他们的状况 是否死亡 我们要做的 就是找出 是哪种食物或饮料 导致死亡 我们用字母Y 表示目标 或效果 最终造成的结果 我们用字母X表示 (会导致死亡的)可疑食物 我们要问 哪一个可疑食物X 是Y的充分条件？ 

这个表明了所有就餐者和菜品的表格 呈现了所有目前能够回答上述问题的可用数据  首先我们看一下第一道菜 汤 这道汤说明了什么？ 

它是否表明了它不足以致死？ 

— 是的 

番茄汤不足以致死 为什么？ 因为安喝了番茄汤 但她还活着 所以 番茄汤致死 不成立 因为安喝了却没有死 

所以 可疑食物X 即番茄汤 不是目标Y 即死亡的充分条件 

凯茜(的事件) 也显示了同样的证据 番茄汤不足以致死 好 我们从主菜一栏又了解到什么呢？ 

是不是 其中有食物也不足以致死？ — 是的 

我们发现鸡肉也不足以致死 因为安吃了鸡肉却没死 

凯茜(的事件) 证明了哪个食物不足以致死呢？ 

凯茜的情形表明牛肉也不足以致死 

我们就此得到一个清单 包含了所有被排除在外 不足以导致死亡的东西 番茄汤 鸡肉 以及牛肉 

葡萄酒呢？ 

关于酒 安 (的事件) 能告诉我们什么？ 这说明 白葡萄酒不足以致死 

凯茜(的事件) 又告诉我们了什么？ 红酒不足以致死 

请注意 安和凯茜(的事件) 提供的 这部分信息 仅告诉我们什么不是致死的充分条件 因为她们活着 所以她们所食所饮的东西 都不足以致死 但是现在 巴尼却死了 所以他食用过或饮用过的东西 仍有可能是致死元凶 充分条件的否定性检验没有排除这两样 当然 番茄汤在他人的事件中被排除了 红酒被凯茜 (的事件) 排除了 但是 鱼呢？ 鱼可能是致死元凶吗？ 它没被排除掉 对吧？ 充分条件的否定性检验没有排除它 因为表里没有某人吃了鱼还活着的情况出现 

但这是否就意味着吃鱼就是死亡的充分条件？ 

不能 因为这仅仅是充分条件的否定性检验 它告诉你什么是不充分的 它没告诉你什么是充分的 对吗？ 

但是 我们还得再研究下 表格中的其他情况  并确认 是否还有尚未被排除的 非导致死亡的充分条件？ 

嗯 馅饼被排除了 因为安吃了馅饼 还活着 凯茜 (的事件) 表明冰淇淋也不足以致死 但从我们已知的信息中可知 蛋糕仍有嫌疑  所以现在 我们有两个嫌疑对象 鱼和蛋糕 它们仍有可能是致死的充分条件 充分条件的否定性检验没有排除这两样 但这并不意味着它们足以致死 

要得出 它们是死亡的充分条件 这个结论 我们要用到的 不是充分条件的否定性检验 而是充分条件的肯定性检验 

### Positive Sufficient Condition Tests

A positive sufficient condition test tells us when we have a good reason to believe that X is a sufficient condition. What makes it positive is it tells you that you have reason to believe that X positively is a sufficient condition, unlike the negative test. And it says that you have a good reason to believe that X is a sufficient condition of Y if all of the following conditions are met. Now I want to warn you, there are going to be four conditions and they have to all be met in order for you to reach a positive conclusion or be justified in reaching a positive conclusion that X is a sufficient condition of Y. 

Now the first condition is pretty simple. It simply says, we have not found any case, where X is present and Y is absent. 

Basically it says, you've already passed the negative part of the sufficient condition test. You can't rule out X as a sufficient condition on the basis of any cases. The second part, says that we've tested a wide variety of cases, including cases where X is present, and Y is absent. 

And the reason that we had to have this condition is that without it we could reach really silly conclusions much too easily. For example, on the basis of the data that we looked at before, we could reach the conclusion that pea soup is sufficient. Because there wasn't a single person who had pea soup and didn't die. There can't be a case 

where somebody had pea soup and didn't die, if there isn't a case where somebody had pea soup. That's why we have to check cases where X is present. 

Similarly, imagine that the only case that we knew was Barney, right, and that means nobody lived, everybody died. 

Well, if everybody dies then we don't have any cases where somebody had tomato soup and didn't die. Or where somebody had fish and didn't die, or somebody had beef and didn't die, where somebody had cake and didn't die. Whatever they had they died, because everybody died. So if everybody dies, it's really hard to tell which of the different candidates is the one that's really causing the death. 

So that's why we have to have some cases where X is present, that is, where the candidate that we're testing is present. And other cases where the target feature Y is absent. And that's what the second part of the positive sufficient condition test tells you that you need. 

Now those two clauses are pretty trivial, but the next one's more important and it's also a little bit trickier. What it says is that if there are any other features that are never present where Y is absent. Then we've tested cases where those other features are absent but X is present. Now, this can be confusing. But the basic idea is that if there are two competing hypotheses, two competing candidates for sufficient condition and neither one is ruled out by the negative sufficient condition test. Then we need to look at cases that would decide between those hypotheses. Now, in our example, we saw that neither fish nor cake is ruled out as a sufficient condition. 

And if we want to decide whether it's fish or cake, this really is a sufficient condition. Then what we need to look at is a case where fish is present but cake is not and a case where cake is present but fish is not. 

We can't be sure from the first three cases because we don't have that combination of fish and cake. So we have to do a little more research. And luckily for us, not for them of course, because one of them dies, but luckily for us Doug and Emily were also at the banquet. And Doug had tomato soup, beef, red wine, and cake and lived. And Emily had tomato soup, fish, red wine, pie, and poor Emily died. The crucial thing where is that Doug had cake, but not fish, and Emily had fish, but not cake. Now, do these cases help us determine whether cake is sufficient for death? Yes, because one of these new cases rules out cake as a sufficient condition of death. 

Which one does that? Well, it's Doug. Because by the negative sufficient condition test Doug had cake and didn't die. So that shows you the cake is not sufficient for death. Now has Emily ruled out anything as a sufficient condition for death? No. Why not? Well, because she died, and if somebody dies they can't rule out something that's a sufficient condition for death. Cases of death can't rule out what's sufficient for death because to rule it out you need a case where the candidates present and the targets not present, okay? So in cases that rule out something as a sufficient condition of death are going to be the cases without death. Anyway, fish still might be a sufficient condition for death. So fish seems to be the only remaining candidate because we ruled out cake. So fish is the only remaining candidate for a sufficient condition, at least among those on the list. Now, we can conclude fish is a sufficient condition for death. Right? No. Because remember, I told you, I warned you, there are going to be four conditions. We need all those conditions to be met in order for us to be reasonably conclude that something sufficient, and this one more to come. Now why do we need more? The answer really is that we don't know whether all the different features that might have caused the death are on our list. We've only looked at the soup course, the main course, the wine and the dessert, it might be something else. So we need to add one more clause, this last positive clause to our positive sufficient condition test. Namely, that we've tested enough cases of various kinds that are likely to include a case where X is present and Y is absent if there is any such case. So, this clause is obviously going to be hard to apply, right. It's not mechanical. How do we know whether we've tested enough cases of various kinds? We have to know what kinds of things can cause death, and which kinds of things can't cause death. 

That's going to depend on background conditions, background knowledge, right. We need to know something about potential causes of death, what can and cannot cause death. We need to take that for granted in applying this last cause, so it's not going to be simple at all. 

But we do know that there has to be some sufficient condition. I mean after all, people don't just die for no reason. And if we know that nothing else could be a sufficient condition. because maybe checked the water, and we looked for syringe marks, and there were no bullet holes, and so on. Then, we have at least some reason to believe that the sufficient condition must be somewhere among the features that we're testing. 

Some people might say it's something else. After all, it could be. I've got an idea. It could be the fact that Barney and Emily both have the letter e in their name. But you know that's not going to cause their death. That's just commonsense background knowledge. We looked at their glasses. There's no poison in their glasses. So we have at least some reason to believe that the sufficient condition must lie somewhere among the features that we're testing. Now this argument is not deductive if something fails the negative sufficient condition test then its valid to conclude that that candidate is not a sufficient condition for that target. 

But if something passes the positive sufficient condition test, then the argument's not valid. It's possible still that this is not sufficient, and that argument, namely an application of the positive sufficient condition test can be undermined by future data. It's defeasible like all inductive arguments. For example, we haven't mentioned Fred, Gertrude, and Harold yet. And what do they show? Well, wait a minute, 

Gertrude shows that fish is not sufficient after all. 

Notice that all the data before Fred seemed to point to the conclusion that fish was sufficient for death. But it just takes one more case, Gertrude, to show that fish is not really sufficient for death after all. That shows that it's an inductive argument, and that means that it's going to be defeasible. Still of course, the inductive argument can be strong if we have enough data, we've looked at enough cases, and our background knowledge really is reliable. So, we're not saying that inductive arguments are no good, but the point is that they're defeasible. 

They're going to be better when we've got more data, when our background assumptions are more reliable and strength then is going to be a matter of degree and can go from slightly strong to very strong. In this case, because of Gertrude, we know that fish is not sufficient. 

So I have to think more about what could still be sufficient. But first let's ask what's necessary 

一个充分条件的肯定测试告诉我们什么时候我们拥有 一个好的理由来相信X是一个充分条件 这种肯定在于告知我们你拥有某种理由 去相信X显然地是 一个充分条件 这一点与消极的测试很不一样 它还说明了你拥有一个好的理由来 相信X是Y的一个充分条件 如果所有 接下来的条件都能吻合的话 现在 我想要告诫你 接下来将出现 四种条件 它们都必须为恰当的 以此 你得到一个正确的结论 或者是被证明为 得到了一个正确的结论 即X是Y的充分条件 

第一个条件很简单 简单地说 我们找不到任何情况出现X是存在的而Y是不存在的情况 

基本上来说 你已经通过了 充分条件测试的否定部分 基于任何情况下你也不能排除X是一个充分条件 第二个部分是这样说的 我们已经测试了广泛多样的各种情况 包括那些X存在而Y不存在的事件 

我们必须拥有这种条件的理由就是 没有它 我们将极其容易地得出 愚蠢的结论 例如 以我们先前看到的那些资料为基础 我们能够得到这样的结论 豌豆汤是充分的 因为没有一个人在喝完豌豆汤后并没有死 这里不能存在这样一种情况 

即某个人食用豌豆汤之后并且没有死 如果 如果这里没有出现某个人食用豌豆汤的事件的话 这就是为什么我们必须查明X存在的情况 

相似地 想像一下我们只知道 巴尼（事件） 是的 这意味着没有人活下来 每个人都死了 

如果所有人都死了 而此时我们并没有任何某个人食用 番茄汤然后没有死的事件 或者某个人食用鱼之后没有死地情况 或者某个人食用 牛肉之后没有死的事件 或者某个人食用蛋糕之后没有死的事件 无论他们食用了什么 他们都死了 因为所有人都死了 所以如果所有人都死了 这就真的很难去区分 哪一种东西才是真正导致死亡的罪魁祸首 

所以 这就是为什么我们必须拥有X存在的情况 也就是说 我们测试的“候选者”存在的情况 并且其他事件中目标特征Y并不存在 这就是充分条件肯定测试的第二个条件 告诉你的你所需要的东西 

现在 这两个线索还是很平常的 但是下一个 会更重要 并且它也更具有难度 它告诉我们 如果这里有 任何其他的Y不存在的不可能发生的特征 因此我们检测了X存在然而其他特征不存在的事件 这可能变得令人困惑 但是最根本的方法是如果两个有相互矛盾的设定 两个互相矛盾的 充分条件的候选者 并且都没有被 充分条件的否定测试所排除 我们就需要看一看 可能决定出两个设定的事件 在我们的例子中 我们看到无论是鱼 还是蛋糕都被排除了作为充分条件的可能性 

如果我们想要决定是否是 鱼或者蛋糕 真的是充分条件 那么我们需要看的就是有鱼 但是无蛋糕的事件和有蛋糕但是无鱼的事件 

我们不能从前三个事件中确定 因为我们并没有鱼和蛋糕的结合体 所以我们需要做更多的研究 对于我们很幸运 而显然不是他们 因为他们中的一个人 死了 但是对我们来说很幸运 道格和艾米丽仍然在宴会上 道格食用了番茄汤 牛肉 红酒 蛋糕 并且活下来了 艾米丽食用了番茄汤 鱼 红酒 派 可怜的艾米丽死了 关键的一点是道格吃了蛋糕 但是没吃鱼 然而艾米丽吃了鱼 但是没吃蛋糕 现在 这些情况能帮助我们决定蛋糕是否是死亡的充分条件了么？ 是的 因为这些新情况中的一个排除了 蛋糕作为死亡的充分条件的可能性 

哪一个做到了这一点？好吧 是道格的情况 因为通过充分条件的否定测试 道格吃了蛋糕并且并没有死 所以这证明了蛋糕不是死亡的充分条件 艾米丽（事件）排除了作为死亡的充分条件的任何事物么？ 并没有 为什么呢？ 因为她死了 并且如果有人死了 他们 不能够排除死亡的充分条件的事物 死亡事件不能排除死亡的充分条件的原因是 排除它你需要一个候选事件存在而目标事件并不存在的情况 所以 为了排除能作为死亡的充分条件的事物 将成为排除死亡的事件 不管怎么样 鱼仍旧可能是死亡的充分条件 所以鱼看上去似乎是仅存的候选者 因为我们已经排除了蛋糕的可能性 所以 鱼是仅存的充分条件的候选者 至少在这个名单之中是这样的 现在 我们可以得出鱼是死亡的一个充分条件 是这样的么？不是的 因为记得么 我告诉过你 我告诫过你  这里将会有四种条件 我们需要所有的条件 以此来 合理地得出某些事物是充分的 这最后的一个来了 现在 我们还需要什么？ 答案就是我们并不知道是否所有 可能导致死亡的不同特征都在我们的名单之中 我们仅仅注意到了汤的情况 葡萄酒以及甜品的情况 这些事主要的方面 还可能 是别的事物 所以我们需要增加更多的可能项 最后肯定的项目 也就是说 我们已经检测了足够多的各类事件 这些事件很可能 包括了X存在Y不存在的事件 如果 真的有这样的事件的话 所以 这一项 显然很难被认为适用 这并不是机械的 我们如何知道是否检测了足够多的各类事件呢？ 我们必须知道什么样的事物可以 导致死亡 以及什么事物不能导致死亡 

这就需要依靠背景条件 背景知识 我们需要知道哪些是潜在导致死亡的事物 什么能或者不能导致死亡 我们需要将适用最后一个诱因视为理所当然的 所以这一点并不简单 

但是我们确实知道这里一定有一些充分条件 我的意思是 毕竟人们不会死无原因 如果我们知道没有什么其他的事物能够成为充分条件 因为可能我们已经检查了水 查看了注射器的痕迹 而且这里没有任何弹孔 等等 我们至少还有一些理由去相信充分条件 一定在我们检测的这些特征之中 

有些人可能会说是别的什么东西 毕竟 这可能是这样的 我有一个想法 事实可能是巴尼和艾米丽的名字中都有同样的字母e 但是你知道这并不会导致他们死亡 这只是背景常识 我们查看过他们的玻璃杯 玻璃杯里并没有毒药 所以我们至少有一些理由相信 充分条件一定在 我们检测的特征项之中 这个论证并不是演绎论证 如果事物没有通过充分条件的否定测试 于是 得出这个备选 并不是这个目标的充分条件的结论就是有效的 

但是如果事物通过了充分条件的肯定测试 那么这个论证就是无效的 还有可能的情况是 这不是充分条件 并且那个论证 即 充分条件的肯定测试的运用 可能会被未来的资料破坏 这是可能会作废的 正如所有的归纳论证一样 比如 我们还没有提到弗雷德 格特鲁德 哈罗德 他们告诉我们了什么？好吧 稍等一会儿 

格特鲁德（的事件）告诉我们鱼并不是充分条件 

注意到所有在弗雷德之前的资料似乎都 指向鱼是死亡的充分条件这一结论 但是只是提出了一种事件 格特鲁德（事件） 来告诉我们鱼并不是真正 导致死亡的充分条件 这告诉我们这是个归纳论证 意味着它即将作废 当然 如果我们有足够的资料 归纳论证也可以变得很有力  我们已经检测了足够多的事件 并且我们的背景知识是可靠地 所以 我们并没有说归纳论证不好 但是情况是它们是可以作废的 

当我们得到更多的资料时 它们可以变得更好 当我们的背景假设更加可靠和有力时 这就会 并且可以从略微地强劲变得非常强劲 在这个情况下 由于格特鲁特 我们知道了鱼并不是充分的 

因此我必须思考得更多 什么还能仍然作为充分条件 但是首先 让我们先问出什么是必需的 

### Negative Necessary Condition Tests

Last time we looked at sufficient condition tests and they tell us what is or is not a sufficient condition. But we also need to know which factors or features or candidates are necessary conditions. 

So this time, we're going to look at necessary condition tests. And as with sufficient condition tests, there's going to be 2 of them. There's a negative necessary condition test that tells you what is not a necessary condition, and then there will be a positive necessary condition test that tells you what is A necessary condition. 

So first, the negative necessary condition test. 

It says simply that x is not a necessary condition of y, if there's any case where x is absent and y is present. Because to be a necessary condition it has to be the case that whenever, x is absent, y is absent too. So if there is even one case, where X is absent and Y is present, that's a counterexample to the universal claim that whenever, that is in all cases X's. 

Where x is absent, y is absent, okay? So let's apply this to our data so far. But let's look first, just at the first 3 people Ann, Barney, and Cathy. You remember them from last time, they were at the banquet. Is pie a necessary condition of death, well, is there a case where pie is absent and death is present? Yes. That means that pie is not a necessary condition of death. Which case shows us that? 

Well, it's Barney. Notice that it's not and. 

Some people get confused about this, but what and tells us is that pie is not sufficient for death. It's Barney that tells us that pie is not necessary for death because with Barney, you get death without pie. So pie was not necessary. For Barney to die. So it's the cases of death that made Barney out of these 3 to tell us what's not necessary for death. 

Now, the case of Barney also tells us that another dessert is not necessary for death. 

Which one is that? Ice cream. because Barnie also didn't have ice cream, and he died, so he died without having ice cream, so ice cream is not necessary for death. 

So, what might be necessary for death? 

Tomato soup might be necessary for death, because out of these 3 cases, there's nobody who dies without having tomato soup. 

Fish might be necessary for death. because out of these cases, there's nobody that dies without having fish. 

Red wine might be necessary. And cake might be necessary. 

Because Barney's the only one who dies, all of those things still might be necessary for death. And the only way to rule out some of those candidates so as to narrow down the field. Is to get more data. So remember Doug and Emily, our old friends from the banquet. 

What do they show us? Is cake necessary for death? 

No, because now we have a case where someone died without eating cake. Namely, Emily. And is fish necessary for death? Oh, well both Emily and Barney had fish. So there is nobody that dies without having fish. So, so far on this data. It looks like fish still might be a necessary condition for death. 

So, since it's survived this far, I guess we can conclude that fish is a necessary condition for death. 

No way, because remember, this is just the negative necessary condition test. It tells us what is not a necessary condition. We still are not in a position to conclude that fish is a necessary condition for death. 

For that, we'll need to look at the positive necessary condition test. 

上节课 我们学习了充分条件的肯定检验 即如何判断什么是充分条件 但我们还需要知道 哪些因素或特征是必要条件 

这节课 我们将学习必要条件的检验 如同充分条件的检验 必要条件的检验有两种 一种是必要条件的否定检验 它告诉我们 什么是非必要的条件 另一种是必要条件的肯定检验 告诉你什么是必要条件 

首先看必要条件的否定检验 

如果存在一种情况 没有X而有Y 则X不是Y的必要条件 因为要成为必要条件 必须满足 当X不存在时 Y也不存在 所以即使只有一个例子表明X不存在时Y存在 也对必要条件的全称命题构成了反例 

即不满足所有情况下X不存在时Y也不存在 现在把这个方法运用到我们的例子 先看这三个人 安 (Ann) 、巴尼 (Barney) 和凯茜 (Cathy) 他们出席了上次的宴会 (例子中) 馅饼是死亡的必要条件吗？  是否存在没有馅饼而出现死亡的情况？ 存在 那意味着 馅饼是死亡的非必要条件 是哪个例子告诉我们的？ 

是巴尼 请注意并不是安 

有些人会搞不清楚 (事实上) 安 (的例子) 告诉我们 馅饼是死亡的非充分条件 而巴尼 (的例子) 则告诉我们 馅饼是死亡的非必要条件 因为巴尼的例子中没有馅饼却出现死亡 所以馅饼对于巴尼的死亡 不是必要的 因此这三人的例子中 是巴尼的死亡告诉我们 什么是死亡的非必要条件 

巴尼的例子还告诉我们 另一个甜点也不是死亡的必要条件 

哪一个？ 冰淇淋 因为巴尼没吃冰淇淋 但他死了 所以他不是因为冰淇淋而死的 冰淇淋是死亡的非必要条件 

那死亡的必要条件会是什么呢？ 

番茄汤也许是死亡的必要条件 因为这三个例子中 每个死者都喝了番茄汤 

鱼可能是死亡的必要条件 因为例子中每个死者都吃了鱼 

红酒可能是必要条件 蛋糕也可能是必要条件 

因为巴尼是唯一的死者 所以这些食物都可能是死亡的必要条件 排除某些食物以缩小范围的唯一途径 是取得更多的信息 回忆一下宴会中的道格 (Doug) 和艾米丽 (Emily) 

他们的例子说明了什么？ 蛋糕是死亡的必要条件吗？ 

不是的 因为有人没吃蛋糕却死了 就是艾米丽 鱼是死亡的必要条件吗？ 艾米丽和巴尼都吃了鱼 所以两位死者都吃过鱼 基于目前的信息 鱼仍然可能是死亡的必要条件 

已经分析到这一步了 我觉得我们可以得出结论 鱼是死亡的必要条件 

那不行 不要忘了这只是必要条件的否定检验 只能说明什么是非必要条件 我们还不能因此结论  鱼是死亡的必要条件 

为此 我们还必须进行必要条件的肯定检验 【果壳教育无边界字幕组】校对：aPRIltenYY 审核： 

### Positive Necessary Condition Tests

The positive necessary condition test, is just like the positive sufficient condition test, except that you change the absent for present in the two positions throughout the test. So, it tells you, that we have good reason to believe, that x is a necessary condition of y, if all of the following conditions are met. And remember, it's gotta be all four that are met before you can reasonably conclude that it really is a necessary condition. 

And it's positive because it allows you to conclude positively it is a necessary condition. 

So the first clause, is that we've not found any case where x is absent and y is present. Again it's just like the sufficient condition test, except that we've changed absent for present. And what this is saying is that this particular candidate, x, is past the negative necessary condition test, and you've got to do that because, if you're ruled out as a necessary condition there can't be adequate reason to conclude that you are a necessary condition because you've been ruled out. Second, we've tested a wide variety of cases, including cases were X is absent and cases where y is present. I mean, after all nobody dies, you can't test to see what's necessary for death. You're not going to be able to have enough data. You can reach silly conclusions, so we need to make sure that we have a bunch of cases where x is absent and a bunch of cases where y is present. Or we're not going to have any reason, at all. 

So, remember our data. What about tomato soup? Is tomato soup necessary for death? Well, it might be, because we didn't have any cases in the first three, at least, where nobody drank tomato soup. So, that would be a silly conclusion to reach. We need to look at cases where people didn't have tomato soup, in order to determine whether the tomato soup really was necessary to cause death in that case. 

Now, the third condition, says that if there are any other features that are never absent where y is present And we've tested cases where those other features are present but X is absent. And the end idea here is that you've got competing hypothesis. Some people might think that one candidate is a necessary condition for death, and other people might think that another candidate is a necessary condition for death, and some people might say, well, I don't know which one, because neither one's ruled out. Well, if neither one's ruled out by the necessary test, then we need to have cases that decide between the competing candidates, the competing hypotheses, to determine what really is necessary for death. So that means that in our example, at least for the first three cases, Ann, Barney, and Kathy, fish and red wine and tomato soup all still might be necessary conditions of death. And to figure out which one really is, we want to look at a case of somebody who has fish and red wine, but not tomato soup, somebody who has fish and tomato soup, but not red wine, and somebody who has tomato soup and red wine, but not fish. So, we need to do more research. 

Now, luckily, again, lucky for us, but not for them, we have additional people who came to the banquet and had just those combinations. Namely, Fred, Gertrude and Harold. Fred had fish and red wine but not tomato soup. 

Gertrude had fish and tomato soup, but not red wine. And Harold had tomato soup and red wine, but not fish. 

So, what does Fred tell us? What does this case rule out as a necessary condition? 

It tells us that tomato soup is not a necessary condition for death, because Fred died without having tomato soup. He had leek soup, instead, and no tomato soup. What does Gertrude tell us? What is this case rule out as a necessary condition? 

Nothing. Why, because Gertrude didn't die, and it's only the cases where people die that can rule out necessary conditions. 

What about Harold, what does Harold tell us. Same thing. Harold didn't die, so he doesn't rule out anything as a necessary condition. 

OK, Gertrude might show us that fish is not a sufficient condition for death. We already talked about that in the last lecture. But since Gertrude and Harold are alive, and don't die, they can't rule out candidates as necessary conditions. So, so far, it looks like, fish might be necessary, but not sufficient for death, given this set of data, with Ann through Harold. It also looks like, red wine, still might be, necessary, but not sufficient for death. 

So, is it reasonable to conclude, that both of these features, both of these candidates, 

are necessary and not sufficient for death. 

No. Not yet. 'Cuz remember, there's a fourth condition. And the fourth condition says that we've tested enough cases, of various kinds, that are likely to include a case where X is absent, and Y is present, if there is any such case. And as with a positive sufficient condition test, this is going to require background knowledge, about what kind of things might or might not be causally relevant, might or might not be necessary insufficient conditions for death. 

It's going to be defeasible, it's not going to be valid because it's an inductive argument. But still, we can get pretty good reason to believe that something's a necessary condition for death, if we have enough cases, with enough variety, and that's what this positive necessary condition test is telling you. What kinds of cases you need, what kind of variety you need. Of course the more cases, and the more variety, the stronger the reason, because inductive arguments come in degrees, but we've got at least some good reason when these conditions are met. But if we've got both fish and red wine as being necessary but not sufficient for death, well, what is sufficient for death. 

That's what we'll have to talk about in the next lecture. 

必要条件的肯定性检验 与充分条件的肯定性检验类似  除了 在检验过程中 将两种情况 下的 无 (absent) 替换成 有 (present) 那么 这个检测将告诉你 现在我们有理由相信 如果下述所有条件都被满足 那么X就是Y的必要条件 并且请记住 只有当四个条件全部被满足 你才能合理推出 它是必要条件 这个结论 

该检测被之所以被称为 肯定性(检验) 是因为它使得你可以推出 它肯定是一条必要条件 这个结论 

那么第一条 是我们没有发现 存在这样一种情况 当无X时有Y 再一次 这个很像充分条件的检测过程 除了我们要将 无 换成 有 这条是说 X 这个待检因素 已经通过了 必要条件的否定性检测 而你必须着手 肯定性检测 因为 如果你排除了一条必要条件 那么并没有充分的理由 来推出 这是必要条件 这个结论 因为你已经将其排除了 第二条 我们已经广泛检测了诸多案例 包括无X的案例 以及 有Y的案例 我是说 毕竟如果没有出现死者 你无法检测什么是死亡的必要条件 你根本没有足够的信息 你会得到很愚蠢的结论 所以 我们必须确定  我们有一组无X的例子 以及 一组有Y的例子 否则 我们根本没有站得住脚的理由 

那么 记住这些信息 番茄汤怎么样？ 它是死亡的必要条件么？ 好吧 它也许是 因为前三起事件中 没有一起事件 至少 没有一人喝过番茄汤 所以 那是个很荒唐的结论 我们得研究下 那些人们没喝过番茄汤 事件中的情况 来确定 那个事例中 番茄汤是否是导致死亡的必要条件 

现在 第三条是 如果有些因素 当Y存在时 这些因素一直存在 并且我们已经检验过那些 有其他因素的存在 但是不包括X 那么 最后的情况是 你完成了假设 一些人也许认为 某种可疑食物是死亡的必要条件 另一些人认为 是另一种可疑食物 导致了死亡 而还有一些人也许会说 好吧 我可不知道是哪一个 因为没一个被排除出去 那么 如果必要条件检测中 二者都没有被排除出去 那么我们就需要一些事件 来比较这些可疑食物 比较这些假设 来确定到底哪一个才是死亡的必要条件 所以我们这个例子说明 至少对于前三起事件来说 即安、巴尼和凯茜 (的事件) 鱼、红酒以及番茄汤 都有可能是死亡的必要条件 接着为了确定到底是哪一个 我们得研究一个例子 第一个人吃了鱼 喝了红酒 不过没喝番茄汤 第二个人吃了鱼 喝了番茄汤 但是没喝红酒 还有一个人 喝了番茄汤和红酒 但是没吃鱼 所以 我们需要更深入的研究 

现在 我们的运气依然够好 当然对他们可不是 还有其他人参加了这场宴会 于是出现了另几种情况 这几个人是：弗雷德、格特鲁德以及哈罗德 弗雷德吃了鱼 喝了红酒 但是没喝番茄汤 

格特鲁德吃了鱼 喝了番茄汤 但是没喝红酒 然后哈罗德喝了番茄汤和红酒 不过没吃鱼 

那么 弗雷德的事件说明了什么？ 这个事件排除了那个非必要条件？ 

该事件说明了 番茄汤不是 死亡的必要条件 因为弗雷德死了 但他没喝过番茄汤 他喝了些韭葱汤 但没喝过番茄汤 格特鲁德的事件呢？ 该事件排除了什么非必要条件？ 

什么都不用付什么都不用付 为什么 因为格特鲁德没死  而只有出现死者的事件才能筛选出必要条件 

还有哈罗德的事件呢 这又说明了什么 一样的 哈罗德没死 所以他的事件没法筛选出必要条件 

好吧 格特鲁德 (的事件) 也许告诉我们 鱼不是死亡的充分条件 在上一讲中 我们已经讨论过这一点 但既然格特鲁德和哈罗德都活着 没死 他们 (的事件) 不能从可疑食物中 排除某样是必要条件的可能性 目前为止 我的想法是所以 到目前为止 看上去 鱼可能是死亡的必要条件 但非充分条件 如果考虑安和哈罗德等人的事件 同样 红酒看上去 也像是死亡的必要非充分条件 

因此 下面这个结论就是合理的  即这两种因素 这两种可疑食物 

都是死亡的必要非充分条件 

不是的 至少当时没有 还记得么 还有第四条呢 这一条说了 我们已经检测了足够多的各类事件 貌似已经包含了 无X而存在Y的事件 如果有这样一个事件 那么 通过充分条件的肯定性检测 这就需要一些背景知识 关于哪些因素对于死亡来说 可能或不可能是偶然相关的 可能或不可能是非充分条件 

这会是没用的 是无效的 因为这是一条归纳论证 但我们仍然有很好的理由相信 某种东西是死亡的必要条件 如果我们有足够多的事件 有足够多的事件类型 而这就是必要条件的肯定性检验告诉你的 你需要什么样的例子 你需要什么样的案例类型 当然 案例越多 涉及的类型越多 理由就越充分  因为归纳论证的强度逐步加深 但至少 上述四个条件全满足时 我们已经有了不错的理由 但是，如果我们知道了 鱼和红酒是死亡的必要非充分条件 不充分条件，那么什么是充分条件呢？ 

我们将在下一讲中讨论这一点 

### Complex Conditions

Last time, we ended with a bit of a mystery. 

We concluded that fish still might be necessary and not sufficient for death, and red wine might be necessary, but it's definitely not sufficient for death. 

The question is, well, if neither of those is sufficient, what is sufficient? To answer that question, we've got to look at complex conditions. Now, complex conditions are just conditions, or features, or candidates, that are combinations, of other candidates, or features or conditions. It might be a negation; not having fish. It might be a disjunction; having either fish or beef. But we're going to look at conjunctions. That is, having some combination of two or more of the food and drink at the banquet. And we're going to understand these in exactly the same way we understood the simple, or atomic conditions, or features, or candidates. 

So, for example, we're going to use the same definition of a sufficient condition. 

F is a sufficient condition for g. Well, what that means is that whenever f is present, so is g. And then we're going to have a negative test for a sufficient condition. This is just reminding you of a couple of lectures ago, that x is not a sufficient condition of y, that is of a certain target, like death, if there's any case where x is present and y is absent. 

Now notice since we used x and y as variables, you can stick anything in for them. So, to get a conjunctive condition, we're going to simply substitute in the conjunction w and x. So, w and x, that combined conjunctive candidate, is not a sufficient condition for y, if there's any case where both w and x are present, 

and y is absent. 

Just like in the other cases, but we're just using a conjunction to replace one of the variables. And we can look at our data from before to determine which conjunctions are, and are not, sufficient conditions for death? So, are there any conjunctions that still might be sufficient conditions for death? What about tomato soup and chicken? Maybe, when you have tomato soup and chicken together, that will kill you. Nope, that can't be, why not? Which case rules out the conjunction of tomato soup and chicken as a sufficient condition of death? Ann does, because Ann had tomato soup and chicken but she didn't die. What about red wine and cake? Is red wine and cake together, as a combination, as a conjunction, is that sufficient for causing death? Is leek soup and fish necessary for death? No. Well who shows that? Barney, because Barney died without having leek soup and fish. 

Is there any other case that shows that? Yeah, Emily shows that, because she died. Without having leek soup and fish. So that combination is not necessary, for death. Okay, so, Barney and Emily, show that leek soup and fish is not necessary for death. What about tomato soup and fish? They both had tomato soup and fish, so maybe tomato soup and fish Is necessary for death. 

Does that work? No, because of Fred. Fred dies without having tomato soup and fish because he has leek soup and fish. 

So Fred shows us that the combination tomato soup and fish is not necessary for death because you can die without that combination. If you have leek soup and fish instead. 

So neither of those combinations is necessary. What might be necessary, which combination is not ruled out. As necessary. 

[SOUND] Or here's one, fish and red wine. 

Fish and red wine might be necessary for death because everybody who died at this banquet had fish and red wine. There was nobody who died without having fish and red wine. So fish and red wine is not ruled out as a necessary condition of death. But wait a minute. 

Fish and red wine was also not ruled out as a sufficient condition for death because everybody who had fish and red wine together died. That means that this particular combination, fish and red wine, is both necessary and also sufficient. 

For death, at least given the data that we have so far. 

I won't go through developing the positive test for conjunctions, because it's going to be just like the positive necessary condition test and the positive sufficient condition test that we went through in previous lectures. You just substitute conjunctions for variables and you get those tests. But it looks like for the data so far we've got at least some reason to belief that fish and red wine is necessary for death and also sufficient for death, great. 

Now we know which combination meets those tests, but what does that tell us? We don't know any mechanism, right? Why would fish and red wine cause death? 

Well, obviously, these people died of bad taste. The chef, who worked all afternoon on the fish, can't stand the fact that people might eat his beautiful fish And have red wine which is going to destroy the taste of the dish. So anybody who ordered red wine with the fish, he poisoned them. That would be the mechanism for why everybody who had fish with red wine died. 

You know, there might be some other story about how some chemical in the fish interacted with the red wine, but If you can rule that out from background knowledge, we've got a pretty good reason to believe that somebody back there in the kitchen, probably the chef, or someone who was mad at them, poisoned them, they died of bad taste. 

Now we need more research to be sure. We need lots more candidates, we need to test various combinations, but that's just an inductive argument. Inductive arguments never make you absolutely certain that the conclusion is true. 

they're defeasable. They're not valid. We know all that. But at least, we have some evidence to believe that fish and red wine is necessary and sufficient for the death. That's what caused these people to die. And it's the chef that ought to go to jail. 

We've gone through one example in some detail, but, like many other things in this course, the best way to learn this material is to practice, practice, practice. So let me give you a little hint. 

You can create all the exercises you would ever want. Just by taking the chart that we've looked at in the last couple of lectures that goes from Ann through Harold and change what each of them had in the soup course or what each of them had in the main course or what each of them had in the wine course or what each of them had in the dessert course. Or change which ones lived and which Which ones died. 

And you can create more examples to practice the necessary condition test and the sufficient condition test. And if you want to know whether you got it right bring your chart and your answer to the discussion forums and the other students in the course can help you out by telling you. Whether they agree about what's necessary and sufficient in the set up that you created. 

So if all you students out there in Coursera land practice, practice, practice by changing the banquet to meet your own specifications, then you'll all learn better. How to distinguish necessary and sufficient conditions and how to test for necessary and sufficient conditions. So go off and have some fun with it. 


上一讲我们遗留了一个小谜团 

我们总结出食用鱼肉仍然可能是导致死亡的必要不充分条件 红葡萄酒有可能是必要 但绝对不是导致死亡的充分条件 

那么 现在问题是 如果前二者均不是充分条件 什么是充分条件呢？ 要回答这个问题 我们需要考虑复合条件 复合条件即：多种条件 特征或者候选项 所得的各类条件 特征 或者候选项 可能是否定—没有食用鱼肉 也可以是并集“或”—食用鱼类或是牛肉 我们将要谈到的是交集。也就是说，两个或两个以上的 宴会上的餐饮食物和饮品的某种组合 我们将使用与之前理解简单/原子条件、特征以及候选项 完全相同的方法来理解这些复合条件 

例如 我们将使用与之前的充分条件相同的定义 

F 是 g 的一个充分条件 也就是说 当F存在 G必然存在 然后 我们将对充分条件做一个否定检验 这只是提醒一下你们 在前几讲中讲到的内容 x 不是 y 的充分条件 即 只要对于一个特定的结论 例如致死  存在X出现 而Y没有出现的情况 

现在 注意到我们使用了变量 记为X和Y 作为变量 你可以将任何条件代入其中 为了得到合取条件 我们将简单地把它换成 w和x 的组合 那么 w且x 这个合取候选项 将不是非Y的充分条件 也就是存在W和X都出现 

而Y没有出现的情况 

正如其他情况一样 我们只不过把其中一个变量 替换为一个合取 查看我们之前的数据 查看我们之前的数据 来判断 哪些合取 是 或者不是 充分 条件 导致死亡 有没有 合取 仍然 有可能是 充分 条件 呢？ 番茄汤 和鸡肉？ 也许，当你 当你 选择番茄汤 和鸡肉 这样的搭配时 你会因此 死亡 非也 这个组合并不致命。 为什么呢？ 哪个人的事件 可以排除 番茄汤 配上 鸡肉 这个组合 是导致死亡的 一个充分条件 这个可能性？ Ann这条数据可以 因为 因为安食用了番茄汤和鸡肉 但她还活着 那么红葡萄酒加蛋糕呢？ 同时食用红葡萄酒和蛋糕，作为 这样一个组合 这个合取 会是致死的充分条件吗？ 同时食用韭菜汤和鱼肉是导致死亡的必要条件吗？ 不是的 那么谁的记录可以表明这一点呢？ Barney， 因为Barney死亡了却并没有同时食用韭菜汤和鱼肉 

还有其他记录能说明吗？是的 Emily 因为她死亡了 而没有同时食用韭菜汤和鱼肉 所以这个组合并不是致死的必要条件 好了 巴尼和艾米丽(的情况) 可以表明韭葱汤和鱼肉不是致死的必要条件  番茄汤和鱼肉的组合呢？ 上述二者都食用了番茄汤和鱼肉，所以 或许同时食用番茄汤和鱼肉是导致死亡的必要条件。 

是这样么？ 不是的，因为Fred。 弗雷德没有同时食用番茄汤和鱼肉 而是韭葱汤和鱼肉 最后死亡 

所以 弗雷德的事件 告诉我们 番茄汤和鱼肉 不是导致死亡的必要条件，因为没有尝试这个组合你也有可能死亡。 你也可能因为 食用韭葱汤和鱼肉 而死亡 

所以这两个组合都不是必要条件。 那么 还有哪个组合有可能是必要条件的没有被排除呢？ 作为必要条件 

【果壳教育无边界字幕组】翻译：卡诺上的泡沫 校对：霁蓝 审阅：霁蓝 还有一个 鱼和红葡萄酒 

鱼和红葡萄酒可能是导致死亡的必要条件 所有曾参加宴会的死者 都食用了鱼肉和红酒 死亡的人中没有人没吃鱼肉也没有人没和红酒。 所以与和红酒不能被排除是到时死亡的必要条件 不过 等一下 

与和红酒也不能被排除是 致死的充分条件 因为所有 吃了鱼并喝了红酒的人都死了 也就是说这个特定的组合 鱼和红酒 是导致死亡的必要条件而且也是充分条件 

就我们目前所掌握的数据来看。 

我将不进行 合取的做肯定性检验 就像前面讲座中谈到过的肯定必要条件验证和 肯定充分条件验证一样 你只需用合取替代单一变量 就可以完成上述检验 但根据我们目前掌握的数据 我们至少可以认为与和红酒是 导致死亡的充分条件 同时也是充分条件 不错 

现在我们知道哪些组合可以通过那些验证测试 这能告诉我们什么呢？ 我们不知道任何机制导致这个结果对吧？ 为什么鱼和红酒会导致死亡呢？ 

嗯，显然，这些人是死于自己的异常品位。 为了那道鱼肉料理忙了整个下午的主厨 不能忍受有人居然 一边品尝他那道色味俱佳的鱼而一边喝红酒 因为那破坏了鱼肉本身的美味 所以当任何人点了红酒和鱼，他就对他们下毒。 这可能是为什么所有食用了鱼和红酒的人都死亡 背后的机理。 

也可能是鱼肉中的一些化学物质 与红酒发生了反应 但如果你具备背景知识 能够排除这个猜测，我们 我们则有理由认为 厨房里某人，可能  可能是主厨 或者对那些死者不满的人 下了毒 他们死于糟糕的品位 

现在我们需要更深入的调查来确认 (这一点)  我们需要参照更多的可能性 测试多种食物组合 组合，但那只是一个归纳论证。 归纳论证永远不能让你 确定你所得到的结论是正确的。 

它们是可被推翻的 它们是不可靠的 我们都知道。 但至少，我们有证据表明 鱼和红酒是致死的必要充分条件 这是导致这些人死亡的原因 并且主厨应该被判入狱。 

我们详细讨论了一个例子，但是，正如这门课中其他知识 一样 学习这些材料的最好方法 是练习，练习，再练习。 所以，来让我给你们一些提示。 

你可以根据之前几讲用涉及的表格 自己设计感兴趣的练习 在前几讲中，我们从 Ann讲到Harold 并且互换了他们 现在(你)可以改变一些条件 他们每个人喝过的汤 他们主菜所食用的食物或他们的 或者选择的饮品 或者品尝的甜点 或者调换死亡的人。 

这样 你就能有更多的例子来练习 必要条件的检验和充分条件的检验 如果你想知道 知道你是否得出了正确的结论 你可以将你的表格和你的答案拿到论坛 讨论，课上的其他同学可以帮助你。 不管他们是否一致认为你的表格中哪些是必要条件 根据你设定的条件所推出的必要条件和充分条件 

如果你们落实了练习 练习 再练习 修改宴会表格来设置你自己的条件 你们都将会学得更好。 如何区分必要条件和充分条件 如何验证必要条件和充分条件 所以课下改改表格来玩吧 

## Causal Confustions

### Correlation Versus Causation

Last time we talked about tests for sufficient conditions and necessary conditions. And those tests have worked fine in a lot of cases, but they're not going to work in all cases. because remember, we were looking at what caused death. 

Death, well, you're either dead or not dead. And we talk about whether the person had fish or not. We didn't look at cases where people liked just a little bit of fish. Either they ate fish or they didn't eat fish. 

But there are a lot of causal relations that hold, not between absolute or dichotomous properties. You're either dead or not dead, you ate fish or you didn't eat fish. Instead, some casual relations hold between properties that come in degrees. For example, carbon dioxide and global warming. Causing heating in the world? What we need to think about is the degree of carbon dioxide. And sure enough, that's what the intergovernmental panel on climate change, the IPCC used to reach its conclusion that increasing levels of carbon dioxide were causing increasing global temperatures. Well, we can't use the sufficient condition test or the necessary condition test. But we can still reach a conclusion about causation. We can even know the mechanism for the causation. 

The carbon dioxide reflects the heat from the sun back to the Earth. Traps it in, like a greenhouse effect, as it's called. 

So the question for this lecture is, how are we going to use arguments to justify those kinds of causal claims? 

So, let's look at another example. Suppose a runner runs a mile, and it takes him ten minutes. Why were they so slow? Well maybe because they were really heavy. 

Now, weight can't be sufficient for running slow, because everybody's got a certain weight. So it's not an on-and-off property. It's a property that comes in degrees. And again, the heavier, the harder it's going to be to run. We know the mechanism, because it takes more energy to move a heavy body. So we've got a pretty good causal story and a pretty good causal hypothesis, but you can't use the necessary and sufficient condition test, because we're dealing with properties that come in degrees. A third example. Suppose the wages go down. Well that's because the unemployment was high. There's always some unemployment. Wages are never as high as you'd like them to be. So how do you get a causal claim? Well, it's because the more unemployment there is, the lower the wages are. because if a lot of people are unemployed, they're willing to take jobs for a lot less wage. 

So we've got a causal story and we've got a causal claim. They seem to justified, but you can't use the necessary and sufficient condition test. We need a different test. 

And the test you need has to deal with properties that come in degrees, and the test that does that is called the method of concomitant variation. It was developed by John Stuart Mill in the 19th Century. Brilliant philosopher. He also developed tests that, basically what we've been calling the necessary condition test and the sufficient condition test, parallel. He gave them different names, but it's the same basic idea. This lecture's on the method of concomitant or concomitant variation, also developed by John Stuart Mill in the 19th century. 

And in order to apply the method of concomitant or concomitant variation, the first thing we've got to get straight is the idea of what are concomitant or concomitant variation is. Well to avoid that word, people these days call them correlations. 

The first kind of correlation we've got to understand is a positive correlation. 

X and Y are positively correlated when an increase in X is associated with an increase in Y, and a decrease in X is associated with a decrease in Y. That's what a positive correlation is. In contrast, a negative correlation is when an increase in X is associated with a decrease in Y, and a decrease in X is associated with an increase in Y. That's why they're negatively correlated, because increase is associated with decrease. Whereas they're positively correlated when increase and increase are associated and decrease and decrease are associated. So let's look at some examples. First of all, calorie intake is associated with weight. More calories you take in, the more weight you're going to gain. So they're positively correlated. 

Whereas weight and exercise are negatively correlated. The more exercise, the less weight, because it burns off those calories you took in, so you get a negative correlation between weight and exercise, and a positive correlation between weight and calorie intake. Another example. Height and age are positively correlated before the age of 20, because people tend to get taller as they grow older. 

But height and age are negatively correlated after the age of 60. Because the space between people's vertebrae tend to decrease after a certain age. 

So, this shows that two things can be positively correlated in some circumstances, and negatively correlated in others. Which correlation holds is going to depend on the circumstances. That is, how old the person is. And now the next question, is how can we get from these correlations to causal relations? 

When two features are correlated, positively or negatively, then there're four possible causal relations between them. First, A might cause B. 

Sometimes, when A and B are correlated, that means that A is causing some kind of change in B. 

Second possibility. Is it B causes A? because the correlation's symmetrical. If A is correlated with B, B's correlated with A. 

And then we don't know whether A causes B, or B causes A. But those are two different possibilities, and we'll have to see how to distinguish them in a minute. 

But the third possibility is that some third thing, C, causes both A and B. If C causes B, and C also causes A, then A and B are going to be correlated. There's never C's there, you get both of them, and when C's not there, unless something else causes them, then they're not going to be there. So A and B'll be correlated simply because of the third thing, C is causing them both. 

And the fourth possibility is that the correlation is purely accidental. A and B just happen to change together. 

Okay? So here are some examples. First of all, let's do an example of A causing B, okay? The speed of driving is positively correlated with automobile accidents and deaths from automobile accidents, because when you're going very quickly in your car, and have an accident, you're more likely to die. Okay, which causes which? It's the speed that causes the accidents and the deaths. The death didn't cause you to drive faster before you died, that seems pretty clear. 

Okay? And what about the second possibility, B causes A? Well, it's just the reverse. You can use the same examples. You can say, automobile accidents and deaths are correlated with fast driving, with speed. 

And in that case, it's not that the thing that we mentioned first causes the thing we mentioned second, it's the other way around. Because as we said before, it's the speed that causes the automobile accidents and the deaths. Not the deaths and the accidents that cause the speed. 

Okay? 

What about the third possibility? That some third thing causes them both. 

Well, here's an example. 

Having yellowed teeth is correlated with having lung cancer. 

But why is that? 

because there's some third thing that causes people's teeth to become yellow. And also causes lung cancer. Namely, smoking. 

So people who smoke tend to have yellower teeth, and they also tend to have more lung cancer. So those are correlated because smoking causes both of them, okay? Another example. In young children, shoe size is correlated with the quality of handwriting. 

As people's shoes get bigger, their handwriting gets better! Well why is that? It's' because they're maturing. And as their bodies mature, their feet get bigger, and also, their handwriting gets better. 

And so now we have an example of each of the first three types of cases that we talked about. What about the fourth? Correlation is accidental. Well, here's an example. The height of my son, and the height of the tree outside the window, well, they're correlated. The taller my son gets, the taller the tree gets. And the taller the tree gets, the taller my son gets. They're symmetrical. They're correlated together. 

But does that mean that something about the height of my son causes the height of the tree? No. Or vice versa? No. Well, you might say there's some third cause, namely maturation. But unlike the case of handwriting and size of feet, where it was the maturation of the same person, the same body. Here, my son's body maturing and the tree's body maturing are just unrelated. You might say that time is the third cause that makes my son grow and also makes the tree grow. But notice that time is an abstract thing that's always there and always moves at the same rate, so it can't really cause my son to grow at this particular moment, or the tree to grow at this particular moment. It's a background condition, rather that a cause in and of itself. So now we've got four possibilities and we've got examples of each. The question that we have to face is, fine, all four are possible. How do you tell which of these possibilities is the one that applies in a particular case? That's going to be tricky. So the problem is, how can we tell which of the four possibilities applies in a particular case? And one simple rule is that when A causes B, A has to come before B. So if the first possibility is instantiated, then you have to have A coming before B, but if the second possibility is instantiated, then you have to have B coming before A. 

Now in the last two, you can have them on any temporal relation you want. But if A comes before B, then you know that B doesn't cause A, and if B comes before A, then you know that A doesn't cause B. So for example, exercise is correlated with weight loss. Could it be that the weight loss causes the exercise? Well, it's possible, I suppose. But if the exercise occurs before the weight loss, then we know that it's the exercise that causes the weight loss, because the exercise occurs before the weight loss occurs. 

We can use that temporal relation to decide what causes what. 

At least in some cases, because sometimes, when you're dealing with a constant factor like CO2 variations or pollution variations over a long period of time, and if pollution causes acid rain, you don't know exactly which part of the pollution is causing which part of the acid rain. And the parts are occuring over a long period of time, so you can't tell which comes first. But at least in cases where you can, like the exercise and the weight loss, then you can say which causes which. Now when they're not in temporal order like that, you have to use a different method. 

The second method of determining what causes what, is manipulation. This method is used in a lot of scientific experiments where they manipulate one factor to see whether that factor causes something else. When you do those types of experiments, you have to make a lot of assumptions, or test a lot of background conditions to make sure that there's no independent factor that's causing the effect. But in the right circumstances, it can work. If you want more detail about which circumstances need to be met, then there're books by Woodward and by Perell that spell this out in great detail. But here, we're not going to go into any great detail. Were just going to give you the basic idea. And the basic idea is that you manipulate A and then look to see whether B changes according to the change in A, and you manipulate B and look to see whether A changes in accordance with the change in B. And that's going to help you determine what causes what, because if when you manipulate A, B changes, then that's an indication that A causes B. Because if B caused A, then manipulating A wouldn't have an effect on B. Think about it this way. 

You put the wood into the engine of a steam train. 

And the wood affects the motion of the train, because it affects the way the engine works. And then the train produces steam. But the steam doesn't cause the train to move. It's caused by the train. So if you manipulate the steam, like with wind blowing the steam around, that's not going to change the train. 

So, similarly, if you change A, and B changes, but you change B and A doesn't change, then that's a pretty good indication that A causes B, and that's going to rule out the second one, right? That can't be true if A causes B, the third one. 

That says that C causes them both, so it's going to rule that out. And the fourth one, it's not just an accidental correlation if A cause B. So if you do that manipulation, you can find out that it really is the first case that holds. At least if all the other conditions are met. Now, you can also do it the other way around. 

If you manipulate B and A changes, but you manipulate A and B doesn't change, then you know that B causes A. 

But, you also know, that A does not cause B, because if it did, then when you manipulated A, B would change. And you know that it's not just some third cause. And you know that it's not just accidental. So now you've isolated the second condition as the one that holds if when you manipulate B, A changes, but when you manipulate A, B doesn't change. Again, this only holds when certain circumstances are in place and I'm not going to go into detail and spell out what those are, but this is the basic idea behind a lot of experiments in science. Here's an example. 

Long time ago, they discovered that smoking correlated with lung cancer, and that led a lot of people to say that smoking causes lung cancer. 

But just imagine that you're a manufacturer of cigarettes. What are you going to do? Well they were pretty inventive. They said, it's not the smoking that causes the lung cancer, it's the lung cancer that causes the smoking! Because when people have certain types of incipient lung cancer, then this lung cancer that's about to develop into full-blown lung cancer, it makes them want to smoke. It creates a discomfort in their lungs that's relieved by the smoking, and that explains why people who smoke more, have more lung cancer. 

So, we think that A causes B, the smoking causes the lung cancer. They're claiming that B causes A, the lung cancer causes the smoking. How do you tell? 

Well you can't look at the temporal relation, because the smoking is going on at the same time when the lung cancer's developing. So you gotta do a manipulation. 

You set it up in a lab. You take a bunch of animals. In this case, it was monkeys, who don't have lung cancer, you check them first, and then you force them to smoke. You put a cigarette in their mouth so that when they're breathing, they're smoking. And sure enough, they developed a lot of lung cancer. No surprise there, poor animals, and that showed that it was lung cancer that was caused by smoking, instead of causing smoking. Why? Because we didn't manipulate the lung cancer, it didn't affect the smoking. But we manipulated the smoking, and that affected the lung cancer. And that shows that it was the smoking that caused the lung cancer. 

Here's another example, which was kind of a mystery for awhile. An economist friend of mine told me about this. Turns out, back in the 1960's,there was a positive correlation between having a television in the home and performance in school. Students were more successful in school if they had a television in their house. Some people actually claimed that television is making them better students. 

But in the 90s, it was the other way around. In the 90s, kids who had televisions in their home did not do as well on average, as kids who had no televisions in their home. 

So there was a negative correlation. So how could there be a positive correlation between television and school success in the 1960s, but a negative correlation between television and school success In the 1990s? 

In order to decide between those hypotheses, you can't manipulate it. You can't go back and change the rate at which they're watching television and change their school performance, and so on. You need to have some background information about the societies of the time and the kind of people who had televisions. 

Well back in the 1960s, it was largely the more affluent, higher socio-economic status people who had television, because they were quite expensive and not that common. 

And those people, typically, are correlated with high school success anyway. High socio-economic status and high school success have been correlated. And so it's that correlation that's explaining why, in the 1960s, students who had televisions in their homes did better in school. 

But in the 1990s, things had turned around. Parents were worried about their children watching too much television. And some parents actually kept televisions out of the home, so that their kids would read more. They had more books, and less television. And those kids were doing better in school, no surprise there. So in the 1990s, there were a lot of people who kept the televisions out, that produced greater school performance, and so you got.different correlations in different times. And the only way to tell what was causing what, was by looking at the background circumstances and knowing something about the societies in which these effects are occurring. 

上一次我们讲到了 充分条件和必要条件的检验 很多情况下这些检验很有效 但它们并非在所有条件下都有效 因为要记住 我们那时在探究死因是什么 

死亡 你要么死了 要么没死 我们还说到了那个人有没有吃鱼 我们没有探究人们只想要一点点鱼的情况 他们要么吃鱼了 要么没吃 

但在绝对属性和二元属性之外 还存在着很多因果关系 你要么死了要么没死 要么吃了鱼要么没吃  相反 一些因果关系 存在于与程度相关的属性里 比如说  二氧化碳和全球变暖 使全世界变暖？  我们需要思考的是二氧化碳的程度  而政府间气候变化专门委员会 即IPCC 正是据此得到这个结论 就是 二氧化碳浓度上涨导致了全球气温上升  在此 我们无法使用 充分条件检验或必要条件检验  但我们仍可得到一个关于因果关系的结论  我们甚至还能了解因果关系的机理 

二氧化碳把来自太阳的热量反射回地球  困住了它 正如我们说的温室效应 

所以本课的问题是 我们要如何用论据  去证明这类因果断言？ 

我们再来看一个例子  假设一个人10分钟跑了一英里  他怎么这么慢？唔 有可能他很重 

但体重不能是跑得慢的充分条件  因为每个人都有一定的体重  所以它不是一个二元属性 而是一个程度属性  再一次地 体重越大 跑步越难  我们知道这个机理 因为移动沉重的身体需要更多的能量  因此我们得到了一个很好的因果描述  和因果假设 但你不能  使用充分条件和充分条件检验  因为我们在跟程度属性打交道  第三个例子  假设工资  减少了  那是因为失业率很高  总有人失业的 工资永远也不会高到如你所愿  那么你怎么得到一个因果断言呢？  嗯 因为失业率越高 工资就越低  因为如果很多人失业  他们将更愿意接受工资少得多的工作 

所以我们得到了一个因果描述和一个因果断言  它们看起来合理  但你不能使用充要条件检验 我们需要一个不同的检验 

而这个检验能处理程度属性  这个测试 被称为共变法 它由约翰·斯图亚特·穆勒（JohnStuart Mill）于19世纪提出 卓越的哲学家 他同时提出了几种检验法 即现称的 充分条件检验及对应的必要条件检验 他对它们的称呼不同 但基本思想是一样的  本课所探讨的共变法  也是穆勒于19世纪所发展的 

为了应用共变法 第一件要搞明白的事情 就是“共变”  到底是什么 为了回避那个词 人们今天称之为相关性 

我们要掌握的第一种相关性是正相关 

X和Y是正相关时 X的增长 关联着Y的增长 而X的减损  也关联着Y的减损 这就是正相关  相反 负相关就是 X的增长  关联着Y的减损 而X的减损 关联着Y的增长 这就是它们为什么  是负相关 因为增长伴随着减损 而它们正相关时 增长和增长关联  减损和减损关联  我们来看一些例子  首先 卡路里摄入与体重相关联  你摄入的卡路里越多 增加的体重就越多 因此它们是正相关 

而体重和锻炼  是负相关的  锻炼越多 体重越轻 因为  它消耗了你摄入的卡路里 所以  你得知体重和锻炼是负相关  体重和摄入的卡路里是正相关  另一个例子 身高和年龄在20岁之前 是正相关 因为人们长大的同时往往也长高 

但60岁之后身高和年龄就负相关了 因为人们的脊椎间隙  在一定年纪之后往往会缩小 

所以 这表明两个事物间可以  在某些情况下正相关 在另一些情况下负相关 哪种相关性成立取决于具体情况  在这里就是 这个人年纪多大 现在 下一个问题是 我们如何从相关性得到因果关系？ 

当两种特性相关 无论正负 它们之间都有四种可能的因果关系 第一 A可能导致B 

有时候 A和B相关 意味着  A导致了B的某种变化 

第二种可能 是否B导致了A？ 因为相关性是对称的 如果A和B相关 B也就和A相关 

那么我们就无从得知是A导致了B 还是B导致了A 但这是两种不同的可能性 我们很快  就会看到如何区分它们 

但第三种可能性是 第三种因素 C 导致了A和B  如果C  导致了B 同时C导致了A 那么A和B就有关联 如果C存在 你同时得到它们 如果  C不存在 除非其他东西导致了它们 它们就不存在 所以A和B相关只是因为  这第三个因素 C 导致了它们 

第四种可能性是 相关性纯粹是偶然 A和B碰巧一起发生了变化 

明白？ 举些例子 首先 我们举个A导致B的例子 好吧？ 超速驾驶与交通事故和 交通事故导致的死亡正相关 因为  如果你开车开得非常快  又发生了一起事故 你很可能会死 那么 哪个导致了哪个？  是速度  导致了事故和死亡  死亡没有导致你生前开得更快 这很清楚 

明白？  那关于第二种可能性 B导致A 又怎样呢？ 情况正好相反 你可以用同一个例子  你可以说 交通事故和死亡  与高速驾驶 与速度有关 

这种情况下 并非 前者导致了 后者 而是反过来 因为正如之前所说 是速度 导致了交通事故和死亡 不是死亡和事故导致了速度 

明白？ 

那第三种可能呢？ 第三种因素导致了两者 

看这个例子 

牙齿发黄和肺癌有关联 

但是为什么？ 

因为有某种另外的因素导致了人们黄牙 又同时导致了肺癌 这就是 吸烟 

所以吸烟的人容易牙齿发黄 而他们也容易得肺癌 因此它们有关联 因为吸烟导致了两者 明白？ 另一个例子 年轻儿童中 鞋码和字迹美丑有关联 

当他们的鞋子增大时 他们写字也写得越来越好！ 好吧 为什么？因为他们在成长 他们身体成长的同时 他们的脚变大了 他们的书法 也变好了 

现在我们对前三种讨论的情况 都有了一个对应的例子 那第四种呢？ 相关性为偶然 看这个例子 我儿子的身高 和窗外的 树的高度 嗯 有关联 我儿子长得越高 树也越高 而树长得越高 我儿子也越高 他们 是对称的 他们彼此关联 

但这是否意味着我儿子身高的某些因素 导致了树的高度？ 不 是否反之亦然？ 不 当然 你可以说可能有第三种因素 即成长 但和字迹与鞋码的例子不同 那里是 同一个人 同一个身体的成长 而这里 我儿子的成长和树的 成长是没有关联的 你可能说时间是那个第三因素 它 让我儿子长大 也让树长高 但请注意 时间是抽象事物 它永远存在 永远在流逝 因此它不能 真正导致我儿子在此刻长大 也不能导致树在此刻长高 它是背景条件 而不是 原因本身 现在我们有四种可能性以及其对应的例子 那么我们面对的问题是 好吧 四种都有可能 在一个特定情形中 你怎么知道 这四种中的哪一个适用？ 这有点棘手 所以麻烦在于 在特定情形中 我们如何知道这四种可能性中 哪一个成立？ 而一个简单的规则是 如果A导致B 则A必先于B发生 所以如果第一种可能性成立 那么你必须让A先于B发生 但如果第二种可能成立 那你必须让B先于A发生 

而对于后两者 你可以让它们有任意的时序关系 但如果A先于B 你就知道B不会导致A 而如果B先于A 你就知道A不会导致B 比如说 锻炼和体重减轻相关 可以说是体重减轻导致了锻炼吗？ 呵呵 也许吧 我猜 但如果锻炼发生于体重减轻之前 那我们就知道 是锻炼导致了体重减轻 因为 锻炼先于体重减轻发生 

我们可以用这种时序关系来判断什么导致了什么 

至少这适用于部分情况 因为有时候 当你 考虑一个恒常因素 如二氧化碳或者 污染物在很长一段时期里的变化 而如果污染物导致了酸雨 你并不能确切知道污染物的哪部分 导致了酸雨中的哪部分 因为这些部分在很长一段时间内持续发生 所以你分不清楚哪个在先 但至少在你能分清的情况下 就像锻炼和体重减轻 你可以说哪个导致了哪个 既然现在它们 没有类似的时序关系 你就必须用一种不同的方法 

第二种方法来判断什么导致什么 这种方法是操纵 这个方法被用于很多科学实验 在实验中 科学家精确操纵一种因子 去观察是否这个因子导致了别的东西 你在做那种实验时 必须做很多 假设 或者检验很多背景条件 去保证没有独立因子 导致结果发生 但在正确的条件下 这个方法管用 如果你想知道关于何种条件要满足的更多细节 那么可参照伍德沃德和佩雷尔的书 讲得很详细 但在此 我们不会涉及太多细节 我只给你们一个基本的概念 这个基本概念就是 你操作A 然后 看看B是否随着A的变化而变化 然后 再操作B 看看A是否随着B的变化 而变化 这将有助于你判断 什么导致了什么 因为如果操作A B变化了 这是A导致B的指示 因为如果B导致了A 那么操纵A就不会对B产生什么作用 可以这样想 

你往蒸汽机车的引擎里放入柴火 

柴火影响了火车的运动 因为它影响了引擎工作的方式 于是火车产生了蒸汽 但这蒸汽并非火车运动的原因 而是火车运动的结果 所以如果你操作蒸汽 比如让风吹散它 并不会改变火车的运动 

因此 类似地 如果改变A B也跟着变了 但改变B时A没有变 那么这是A导致B的强烈指示 而且它排除了第二种情况 是吧？ 如果A导致B 那第二种情况不可能是成立 而第三个 

它说C导致了两者 所以它也被排除了 而第四个 如果A导致B 那它们之间就不是一个偶然关联 因此 如果你进行一点操纵 你就能找到 确实只有第一种情况成立 至少在其他条件都满足的情况下 你也可以反过来 

如果操作B而A变化了 但操作A 而B没有变化 那么你就知道 B导致了A 但是 你也知道 A不是B的原因 因为如果它是 那么 操作A时B就会变化 你也知道 并没有什么第三种原因 然后你知道它也不是巧合 所以你筛选出第二种成情况 在操纵B时A变化 但操作A时B不变时成立只有它成立 再次强调 只有在一定情况下这个结论才成立 而我不打算列出所有的 适用情况 但这个基本概念蕴涵在 很多科学实验里 我举个例子 

很久以前 人们发现吸烟和肺癌相关 这导致了很多人声称吸烟引发肺癌 

但假设你是香烟制造商 你会怎么做？ 实际上他们挺会发明的 他们说 不是吸烟导致了肺癌 而是肺癌导致了吸烟！ 因为如果人们处在某种肺癌的早期 而这种肺癌早晚会 发展成晚期 它就会使人想吸烟 因为它让人们的肺不舒服 只有吸烟 才能缓解 这就解释了为什么 吸烟越多的人群患肺癌也越多 

所以 我们认为A导致了B 吸烟导致了肺癌 而他们声称是B导致A 肺癌导致吸烟 你怎么分辨？ 

你不能参照时序 因为吸烟 和肺癌发展处在同一个时期 所以你必须做一个操纵 

你在实验室里设置好 然后找来一堆动物 在本例中 我们用没有肺癌的猴子 你先检查它们 然后你强迫它们吸烟 你把香烟插进它们嘴里 使得它们在呼吸的同时 也在吸烟 显然 它们中很多得了肺癌 不出所料 可怜的家伙们 结果显示 肺癌是吸烟的结果 而不是原因 为什么？ 因为我们没有操作肺癌 它没有影响到吸烟 但是我们操作了吸烟 而它影响了肺癌 这就表明 是吸烟导致了肺癌 

另一个例子 它曾是一个长期的谜 这是一个经济学家朋友告诉我的 是这样 1960年代 拥有家庭电视与 在校成绩曾显现出正相关 学生们 如果家里有台电视 那么他在学校的成绩越好 一些人甚至声称电视机能促进学生发展 

但到了90年代 情况反过来了 在90年代 家里有电视的孩子们平均而言 并没有家里无电视的孩子们表现好 

所以这里呈现的是负相关 因此 怎么可能在60年代时 电视和在校成绩呈正相关 到了90年代时 电视和在校成绩又呈负相关呢？ 

你不能操作假设去判断它们 因为你无法回到过去改变 电视普及率 或者改变他们的在校成绩 等等 你必须掌握一些当时社会的背景信息 以及什么样的人拥有电视 

在1960年代 是那些 相对富裕的 有更高社会经济地位的人 才拥有电视 因为当时的电视很昂贵 不常见 

典型地 那些人也就 和出色的在校表现有关联了 高社会经济地位和出色的学校表现有了相关性 因此是这个相关性解释了 为什么 1960年代 家里有电视的学生们会 在学校里更出色 

但到了1990年代 情况变了 父母担心孩子看太多的电视 某些父母甚至把电视赶出家门 为的就是让孩子更多地阅读 这些孩子读书多 看电视少 而他们在校表现也越好 不出奇 所以在90年代 很多人家里不摆放电视 这导致了更好的在校成绩 因此你在不同的时代得到了不同的相关性 而判断什么导致了什么的唯一方法 就是审视 背景条件 了解引发了这些结果的 社会的相关信息 

### Causal Fallacies

There's a lot more to say about causation and we can't say it all here. You really ought to take a whole course about causation and it's many different forms. But, we can help you avoid some of the most common fallacies. Here we'll look at two common fallacies. The first one is simply confusing an accidental correlation with a causal relation. 

Sometimes, this is called post hoc ergo propter hoc, or some people pronounce it post hock ergo propter hock. And what it means in Latin is after this therefore because of this. And the idea is that they're correlated. One occurs after the other and you conclude the second one must occur because of the first one. It's really just an accidental correlation and it's a fallacy to conclude that it's a causal relation. And, of course, the classic example occurred one time at a hotel, with my son, we got onto the elevator, and I reached for the button. I wanted to push the button for the floor that we wanted to go to, but my son said, no daddy no, don't do it. I said okay, and the he reached up and pushed the button, and just as he pushed the button the fire alarm went off and he started crying because he had made the fire alarm go off. But of course he was just committing the fallacy of, post hoc ergo propter hoc. 

The fire alarm didn't go off because he pushed the elevator button, it just happened to go off after he pushed the elevator button. Now that might seem like a silly mistake that only a child would make, but you'll be surprised how many times you can find this mistake being made in serious discussions in newspapers. Just take a look for yourself. Now the second common fallacy that I want to describe is confusing a cause with an effect. 

Here are some examples. I'm a golfer and sometimes I go out and play golf and my back is just killing me and I'm thinking it must be why I'm playing so bad. I can't hit the ball, I keep knocking it off to the side and I blame it on my back. So I think, it's the pain in my back that's causing my bad swing when actually, it's my bad swing that's causing the pain in my back. I'm like, twisting around the wrong way, and that's causing a back ache. So I think, that it's the pain in my back that's making me swing badly. It's actually the bad swing that's causing the pain in the back. 

So that's just an everyday example. 

Here's an example in football, American football we're talking about here. It was noticed that there was a correlation between the number of forward passes and how often the team was losing. Teams that had a lot of forward passes were losing more often. So some coaches concluded, well we ought not to pass the ball so much because passing the ball causes you to lose. 

That's not what was going on. What was going on is that in the last quarter of the game the team that was behind would get desperate. They needed to score a lot of points quickly and running the ball wasn't going to do that, so they tried passing the ball, and they would pass more and more and more in order to catch up. And that meant it was the fact they were losing the game that caused them to pass the ball so often. It wasn't passing the ball often that was causing them to lose the game. 

So again, they were confusing cause with effect. 

Here's a third example. 

Turns out that many schizophrenics smoke and take drugs and alcohol. 

And so there's a correlation between schizophrenia and drug and alcohol use including nicotine from smoking. 

Some people concluded it must be the drugs and nicotine cause schizophrenia. 

No, that's not what's going on. That's the fallacy of confusing cause and effect. 

What's really going on is that their schizophrenia is causing them to smoke and drink more and to take drugs. 

So again, what people get confused about is they think that one thing causes another, when it's really the other thing that causes the first thing. They're getting the relation backwards and confused. And that's something that you need to be really on the lookout for as you try to figure out what causes what in your everyday life because if you make that mistake you're going to get confused and you're not going to know what manipulations will change what features in your life. And that's why causal relations are important, to figure out how to get around in the world and bring about the changes that you want. So watch out for these fallacies and do the best you can do figure out how the world works. 

But, after seeing how hard it is to establish causal relations, you might be wondering whether this lecture has really caused you to learn anything at all. So, I leave you with this cartoon. 

关于因果关系的讨论有很多， 但在这里我们无法涵盖所有 你们真应当上一门完整的 关于因果关系的课 或者 许多与之形式相近的课 不过，这门课可以帮助你们避免一些 最常见的谬论 今天我们将讨论两个常见的谬论 第一个 是把意外相关和非因果相关 混为一谈 

有时 这被称为 

“后此 所以因此” 有些人 也会读作“post hock ergo propter hock” 它是由拉丁文翻译而来，意思是： “在此之后，因而必然由此造成” 并且这两件事是被认为相关联的 只是因为一件事发生在另一件之后 你 就下定结论 因为第一件事第二件事必然发生 实际上这确实只是一个偶然的联系， 所以 断定这是一个因果关系是一个谬论。 有一次我和儿子在一间酒店里 就犯了这么一个经典的错误。我们进了电梯，我 伸手去按按钮。 我刚想去按我们想去的楼层的按钮， 我儿子说：“爸爸，你不要按， 让我来”。 我说，那好吧。然后儿子伸出手去 按下了按钮，就在这时， 火警报警器响了， 他开始大哭因为他觉得是自己 触发了报警器 但当然他只是犯了“后此故因此”的错误 

火警报警器不是因为 他按了电梯按钮而响 只是碰巧在他按了电梯按钮以后响起 这看起来似乎是只有孩子才会犯的 一个愚蠢的错误，但 令人惊讶的是，这样的错误在报纸上的严肃 论辩里出现的异常频繁， 你可以自己去看一看。 接下来 我想说的第二个常见的谬论 是把原因和后果混为一谈 

我来举一些例子 

我平时打高尔夫 有时候我在外面打 高尔夫的时候 背疼的厉害 我就想 这一定是我球技糟糕的原因 我打不中球，不停的把它打到旁边， 我把失误全归咎到我的背疼上。 所以我想，是背疼 造成了我挥杆 失误，然而实际上正是我错误的挥杆 才造成了我的背疼。 由于我挥杆姿势错误， 我开始背疼， 所以 我觉得，是我的背疼 让我乱挥一气。 而实际上是我错误的挥杆姿势 造成了背疼 

这只是个日常生活中的例子 

再举个橄榄球的例子 我指的是美式橄榄球 有人发现 一个球队的 前进传球数和输球次数是有关联的 前进传球数多的球队 往往输球次数更多 所以有些教练下结论说 我们不应该传 那么多次球 因为传球会导致我们输球 

其实事情不是这样的 真实情况是 在比赛进行到 最后四分之一时 落后的球队会变得孤注一掷 他们需要迅速地 进球得分 但是光靠运球是不行的 所以他们会尽力传球 并且 为了赶上比分 他们传球次数会越来越多 这就意味着是他们将要输掉比赛 这个事实让他们频繁的传球， 并不是因为频繁传球 导致他们输掉比赛 

所以 他们再一次把原因和后果混淆了 

下面是第三个例子。 

事实证明很多精神分裂症患者都抽烟、 酗酒和吸毒。 

所以 精神分裂症与 毒品、酒精、尼古丁是有关联的。 

有些人断定一定是毒品 和尼古丁导致了精神分裂症 

但这并不是事实 这只是混淆了原因和后果的谬论。 

事实上 正是精神分裂症导致 他们吸烟 吸毒和酗酒 

所以 这再次说明 令人们费解的是 他们认为是一件事 导致了另一件事 然而实际上却是另一件事造成了第一件事 他们把两者的关系倒置了 所以感到困惑 当你努力搞清楚是什么影响了你的日常生活时 你必须时刻注意这件事 因为如果你犯了这个错误 你会感到困惑 并且你不会搞清楚 怎么做 才能改变现状 这就是为什么因果关系 非常重要的原因 它是为了让人们学会怎样 在世界上生存 并且带来你想要的改变 因此 注意别犯这些谬误 并 尽你最大的努力去弄清世界 运转的规律。 

但是 既然你们已经知道 建立因果关系是如此之难 你可能在想这堂课是否真的让你 学到了一些东西 所以 我给你们留了这一幅漫画 

### A Student Example: Causal Reasoning About Chocolate

We received a wonderful example of, for the kinds of bargains we studied in the weeks on inductive reasoning. We studied generalization, and we studied applications of those generalizations. And using that for causal reasoning that we tested by manipulations and by the sufficient condition tests, and all of those are brought together in a wonderful little video. So, take a look. >> Hello. My name's Katrina, and I live in Sweden. 

I've spent many years, eating a little bit of chocolate everyday. And I've always strongly believed that eating chocolate makes you happier. In other words, most people will be in a better mood after they've eaten chocolate than before. 

And I'll give you four pieces of evidence in support of my conclusion. 

Evidence one: I've met a lot of people over the years and when I give them some of my chocolate, they always seem happy about it. I can't think of a single case of someone eating chocolate who hasn't looked satisfied afterwards. 

Evidence two: It could be that eating chocolate isn't really causing their happiness. They're just happy people eating chocolate. 

So, I asked unhappy people whether they ever eat chocolate. And they confirmed that they do precisely because it cheers them up. Evidence three: Now, I went to a chocolate factory where the workers get free chocolate every day. 

And these people could theoretically be unhappy like the rest of us could. but they all had smiles on their faces, and some smears of chocolate. 

Evidence four: You may ask whether these people are also in love and it's love that's causing the happiness. Not actually the chocolate. 

So I had to find people who eat chocolate, but are not in love. 

I did a mini survey at my corner shop. 

And 80% of the people who responded that they were not in love, reported that they definitely felt their mood improve when they ate chocolate. 

So, it does seem to be the case that eating chocolate is probably sufficient to improve your mood. 

Obviously there are people who never eat chocolate and are very happy. For example a successful dieter or your dentist. 

You can find happiness by falling in love or getting promoted or finally reaching the top of Mt. Everest, whatever's your biggest dream. But for an instant helping of happiness, chocolate will cheer you up, mm. >> Wasn't that great? I already knew that I loved chocolate and that it improved my mood, so maybe I was convinced by this argument because, I already believed the conclusion. And that's when you ought to be careful. When you look at an argument, and it's for a conclusion you already believe, then there's going to be a tendency to think it's a great argument. 

so if you really want to know whether it is or is not a good argument. You gotta look carefully at the ones that are trying convince you of things that already had a tendency to believe in the first place. So let's look carefully at her conclusion. Katriana's conclusion was very carefully qualified. One the one hand she said that chocolate is one of the things that makes you happy. She doesn't claim that it's the only thing that makes you happy. Love might make you happy, climbing Mount Everest might make you happy, all kinds of things can make you happy. She's only claiming that chocolate's one of them. Another qualification, is that she says that chocolate will probably improve your mood. 

Don't say it's definitely. Don't say it works always, or for all people. But it'll probably improve your mood. So it's an inductive argument, and she doesn't have to prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt. That's a good move in an argument, because it's very hard to prove things beyond a shadow of a doubt. 

But there is one part of her conclusion that makes the argument difficult. And that's that she says chocolate improves your mood. Now that's a causal claim. That's not just that you eat chocolate and you also happen to be happy. That's that eating chocolate causes you to be happier than you were before. That is, to be in a better mood than you were before. So let's see if the different bits of evidence that she presents really do, support that conclusion. 

So the first bit of evidence that Katrina provides is this. Now I've met a lot of people, over the years, and whenever I give them some of my chocolate they're clearly happy about it. 

What kind of argument is that? That is a statistical generalization from a sample. because she hadn't met everybody in the world. She's only met some people. But the sample that she's been able to check, they've all liked chocolate. 

She adds one more claim. I can't think of a single case of someone eating chocolate and not looking satisfied afterwards. I know this is kind of repetitious, because she says she can't think of a case. She just told you that whenever she gives them chocolate, then they're happy and if they're happy they're satisfied, and so maybe that doesn't add too much. It's still a generalization. What are we going to think about this generalization? 

Well, let's assume that she's got a lot of friends. So, she's checked a lot of people, she's given a lot of people chocolate and, and they're all happy. Well, is the premise true? Well, do we believe that every single person that she gave chocolate to was satisfied and happy. I kind of tend to doubt that Katrina, sorry, but it's just, such uniformity is unusual among human beings. And so my bet is that a couple of them didn't. But notice that she didn't really need that, because she's only arguing that giving chocolate will probably improve your mood. Not that it always will for everybody. So she doesn't need that strong claim about everybody. So she's still on pretty firm ground, with regard to claiming that almost everybody, or most of the people, have improved their mood when she gave them chocolate. 

We still might worry about a bias sample. There might be some cultures out there, or some types of people out there, that don't like chocolate. Maybe they're allergic to chocolate, or something like that, that would be really sad. I'm sorry to even think about that, it makes me sad. But, there probably are, and they're people that don't like chocolate. And so, it's not going to work for them. So maybe she wants to qualify her conclusion a little bit, you know, among the groups that I've met, different cultures might be different, different biological conditions might make people allergic to chocolate. But, with regard to most of the people she's met, chocolate seems to work pretty well. So we've got now a statistical generalization, most people, 

if you give them chocolate it improves their mood. Great. What does that show you about you, because remember her conclusion is that if you have chocolate, then that chocolate will probably improve your mood. So now she needs to take that generalization and apply it back down to you as an individual, to make a prediction about what'll happen to you if you eat some chocolate. So in this particular bit of evidence, she needs to generalize up. To most people, will have their mood improved if they eat chocolate, and then back down again. And since that's true with most people, and you're not special in any particular way. 

Or it would be a conflicting reference class fallacy. Since you're not special in any particular way, the chocolate will also improve your mood. That's the way this first bit of evidence seems to go. 

So now we're ready for her second bit of evidence. Let's get all adjusted here so that we can think about this new bit of evidence that Katrina provides. Okay, what she says is: it could be that chocolate isn't really causing the happiness. Maybe they were just happy before eating the chocolate. Now, that's a problem. If you're going to say that it improves people's moods when they eat chocolate, it's not good enough that people are already happy, and then that makes' em want to eat chocolate. And so they eat chocolate to celebrate how happy they are. Well you gotta prove that it actually does cause the improvement in the mood. Okay, how are you going to do that? Well, we looked in the lectures on induction at causal reason. 

What you need to do is manipulate. 

You want to look at people who are not happy And see if the chocolate makes them go up in mood. And manipulate the amount of chocolate, manipulate how happy they are, and see how those have effects on each other. And that's how you decide among the hypotheses. And that's exactly what Katriana does. So I asked some unhappy people, whether they ever eat chocolate. And they confirmed that they do. Precisely, because it cheers them up. 

so now we have a sample of people, where we've manipulated their happiness. We've looked at happy people and unhappy people. You've looked at people at times when they're happy and times when they're unhappy. And then we can look at their chocolate consumption and we can check to make sure that they're happier afterwards. It's just like, checking whether smoking causes cancer. We talked about that in the lectures on induction. If you want to know whether smoking causes cancer, what you do is you induce smoking, in creatures, in this case lab monkeys, that did not previously smoke and see whether that increases their cancer rate. And what she's doing is she's saying, let's take people that don't have happiness, give them chocolate and see if that increases their happiness. So she's using exactly the kind of manipulation test we talked about in the lectures on induction. Good job, Katriana. 

Now let's switch to the fourth bit of evidence, and I want to get ready for that one too. Now, what Katriana says for her fourth bit of evidence is, you may ask, what if all these people are also in love, and it's love that's making them happy, not really chocolate. because remember, she doesn't want to claim chocolate's the only thing that makes you happy. Love might be sufficient for happiness, just like chocolate also, causes happiness. 

How are we going to tell which one it is? 

Well, in the lectures, on causal reasoning, when we were looking at the tables, and the diners who died from the poisoned food, one of the points that we made was that, if you have two candidates for a sufficient condition. You've gotta look at situations where one of them is present without the other and the other present without the first one. And that's exactly what Katriana does. 

She says, I had to find people who eat chocolate, but are not in love. Whoa, well that's what you're looking for, because if you have some people who eat chocolate, but are not in love, and some people who are not in love but eat chocolate, you can test it. And what did she find? 

Well, I did a mini-survey outside my nearest corner shop and 80% if the people who confessed that they were not in love said they definitely felt their mood improve When they ate chocolate. Notice she's not claiming it's so universal, 100% anymore, she's down to 80%. Good move. But in addition, she's now ruled out that it's really the love that's the only sufficient condition, even when the love's not present, you still get happiness with eating chocolate. 

So that's applying one of the tests that we talked about in the section on causal reasoning to test for sufficient conditions. 

Okay, we've done our bits of evidence one and two and four. We skipped over number three. So what's your third bit of evidence? Now, we've gotta look at that one. Okay, what Katriana says is, I went to a chocolate factory where all of the workers eat chocolate every day. Not only that, it's free. Free chocolate! Yeah, mm! 

I love it. Like everyone else, these people could theoretically be unhappy, but they have smiles on their faces. Wouldn't you? Free chocolate all day long. But wait a minute, wait a minute. Is this a good argument? Like I said, it's a conclusion I like. But we still gotta look at it critically. Sorry Katriana, these people are happy. But how do you know that they're happy because of the chocolate, right? They've got a job in the factory. It's good having a job. 

Chocolate's very popular, so maybe the factory's doing really well, which means they can pay them more money, better benifits, good job. Maybe that's what's making them happy? Sure, all these people in the factory are happy. But it might not be the chocolate. It might be the fact that they got a good job. So I think this fourth bit of evidence is not really all that strong. Her number three, by the way. The fourth one we considered. 

It's not all that strong. Now, what does that show you? You could say, Wait a minute, she's got four arguments. One of them's no good, so it all is back to nothing. 

But of course, that's not the right way to think about it. She gave us four bits of evidence. If one of them doesn't work, and we've only got three left, we've still got three left. So if those first three bits of evidence are good, And if they show at least that it'll probably improve your mood, and they establish the cause of conclusion that she claimed, then it seems to me she's given us pretty good evidence for the conclusion she was claiming. And in doing so, she's exemplified a lot of the different forms of reasoning that we studied in the weeks on inductive reasoning. So, thank you very much, Katriana, for submitting this wonderful video, this wonderful argument. We all learned from it and we appreciate it.
